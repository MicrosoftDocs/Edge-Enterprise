# Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page

The Enterprise new tab page is a direct response to a new challenge that workers face daily: frequent context switching. Our research shows that in addition to managing schedules, workers juggle roughly three projects a day—and on average, switch between them two to three times a day. Combine that switching with a torrent of emails, pings, and calls (which, when combined, can easily number in the triple digits) and they’re constantly switching contexts throughout their day. Finally, add on the challenge of hybrid workplaces and it’s no wonder they want to work smarter not harder.

## The role of the browser

As the browser role grows to become central for workers to finish everyday tasks, it’s more important now than ever that information workers can cut through the noise and find what they need. That’s why we’ve created a personalized productivity dashboard right in the Microsoft Edge Enterprise new tab page. Any enterprise user of Microsoft Edge can use this by opening a new tab and then selecting the **Microsoft 365** tab.

This dashboard is a focal point for quickly finding the information you need and stay up to date on the things that matter most, all while cutting out the noise. Now, we’ll highlight some of the top features that can help keep your employees productive.

We’re continuously looking to improve the browser experience so we want to get your feedback, which you can provide by pressing alt + shift + I to open the **Send feedback** dialog where you can share your thoughts.

## Microsoft 365 feed

Do you feel overwhelmed by trying to keep up with all the updates at work? The Microsoft 365 feed is personalized to you and your work. This feed uses Microsoft 365 data to bring you the most important information happening around your organization. From at mentions, to files being edited, to meeting recordings you might want to catch-up on, to colleague promotions, and so much more. This experience helps keep you up to date on the most important information at a glance.

## Recent SharePoint sites card

Tired of jumping through hoops to get to your SharePoint sites? Here’s a shortcut to help you get the information you need to be productive, even faster.

## Quick Access list

Our research shows that information workers can handle tens, if not hundreds of files over a given week. This volume can get overwhelming when you don’t know where each file is saved or who sent it to you. This module ranks files we think are most important to you to help you find them quickly. Don’t see them here? That’s okay, you can either use our new Work Search features (information later) to look up the file name or the name of the colleague who sent it to you, or use the **More in Office.com** link at the bottom of the list to hop to Office.com and find it there.

## Upcoming events card

One of the most important aspects of keeping up with a fast-paced work environment is knowing what meetings you have coming up and when they're scheduled. As if it wasn’t hard difficult enough to begin with, hybrid work has increased the number of meetings for many workers, causing overload. No productivity dashboard is complete without a glanceable calendar to make sure you’re prepared for your meetings. And with one click you can join your Teams meeting or send a message to other attendees if you happen to be running late.

## Important emails

We see that information workers are receiving an average of 200 email communications a day in the modern workplace! How are you supposed to keep up on those and get your work done? This experience uses AI models to only show your most important emails based on who sent them, their urgency, and other factors to let you feel confident you’re not missing anything important while you get your work done. No more checking Outlook every 3 minutes in case your manager emailed you!

## To Do task list

One of the most effective ways for many users to stay productive when they’re getting overwhelmed is to make a to do list. This keeps users organized and can be cathartic to check items off the list when they are feeling stressed. We have To Do integration in the browser so you can get all the greatness of [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/) in an easily accessible format.

## Address bar

Trying to find something for work, but can’t quite figure out where to start? Just search for it! The Microsoft Edge Address bar (URL box) supports finding work content through Microsoft Search for Bing (MSB). Type your query and search or select one of the auto-suggested work results in Microsoft Suggests. You can also click on "Search [your company]" banner for work information only. 

## How to make Microsoft 365 the default tab

If you’re a user, click the **Microsoft 365** tab at the bottom of your new tab page in Microsoft Edge and when you return to the page it should be set as the default!

For tenant admins, if you’d like to have your organization automatically set Microsoft 365 as the default tab, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/Adminportal/Home).
2. Go to **Org settings** > **News**.
3. Under **News**, **select Microsoft Edge new tab page**.
4. Select the toggle in the next screenshot that says "Users default to Microsoft 365".
