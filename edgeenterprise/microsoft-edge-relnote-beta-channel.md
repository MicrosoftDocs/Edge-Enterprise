## Version 118.0.2088.11: September 20, 2023

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business Banner.**  Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser across managed and unmanaged devices. The in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner is being deprecated and will no longer be visible.

- **Find on page.** Searching for a word or phrase on a webpage has become easier with the new smart find update to Find on page. For more information, see
[Find on page](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/find-on-page?form=MT00D8). Now when you search with Find on page, we suggest related matches and synonyms making it effortless to find what you're looking for, even if you misspell a word in your search query. When you search, simply select the suggested word to quickly locate the desired word or phrase on the page. Data is sent to Microsoft for processing.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge's Privacy Whitepaper](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper/). Administrators can control the availability using the [RelatedMatchesCloudServiceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#relatedmatchescloudserviceenabled) policy.

- **New SmartScreen policy.**  The [ExemptSmartScreenDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptsmartscreendownloadwarnings) policy lets administrators create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from SmartScreen AppRep warnings.  Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to file type extension-based security warnings and mixed-content download warnings.

- **New Microsoft Edge Update policies.** The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** and **MeteredUpdates** policies allows administrators to control the "Download Updates over metered connections" setting (`edge://settings/help`). The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** applies to all apps and **MeteredUpdates** applies to targeted apps. When a policy is configured to Allow, updates occur on a metered connection, such as cellular connections or others where data usage is controlled.

### Announcement: Deprecating the unload event

The Google Chrome team plans to deprecate the unload event starting in Chrome version 117. The deprecation is done by gradually changing the default so unload handlers stop firing on pages unless a page explicitly opts in to re-enable them. For more information, see [Deprecating the unload event - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/deprecating-unload/), and [Google Groups - Conversations](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/dvusqw9-IhI/m/SBkm_u1RAQAJ).

While we haven't yet finalized the deprecation schedule, we anticipate that Microsoft Edge  follows Chrome's schedule with a possible delay of a release or two. If you're interested in testing with Microsoft Edge starting in version 118, the **ForcePermissionPolicyUnloadDefaultEnabled** policy is available or you can use the instructions documented at [Disable unload handlers by default and add Permissions-Policy to opt-in to enabling them](https://github.com/fergald/docs/blob/master/explainers/permissions-policy-deprecate-unload.md#disable-unload-handlers-by-default-and-add-permissions-policy-to-opt-in-to-enabling-them).

WebView2 supports both the permissions policy and the enterprise policy but won't be impacted by the gradual rollout in Microsoft Edge. We expect WebView2 will switch defaults when the roll out reaches 100% of page loads.
