      - question: |
          Internet Explorer mode diagnostic information
        answer: |
          You can get Internet Explorer mode diagnostic information on the Microsoft Edge Compatibility tab. To open this tab, go to *edge://compat/iediagnostic*. This page may show diagnostic messages. This page also provides configuration information for the following categories:
          
          - **Registry key check**. (Displayed only if the check fails.) Checks to see if Internet Explorer integration is set up correctly in the registry. If not, the user can click **Fix it** to resolve the problem.
          - **Internet Explorer mode**. Shows the API version that's used, based on the configuration and OS. If there's a problem, the user may be prompted to install a **Windows Update**.
          - **Internet Explorer mode setting**. Shows whether Internet Explorer mode is enabled, and how it's configured.
          - **Command line**. Shows the command line string and switches used to start Microsoft Edge.
          - **Group policy settings**. Shows whether IE mode is configured using group policies, and the policies that are applied.
          
      - question: |
          Error message: "To open this page in Internet Explorer mode, reinstall Microsoft Edge with administrator privileges."
        answer: |
          You may see this error if you don't have all required Windows Updates. See the prerequisites listed in [About IE mode](./edge-ie-mode.md) for the required versions of Windows and Microsoft Edge.
          
          If you've already installed all required Windows Updates, you may see this error if:
          
          - You're using the Canary channel, which is installed at the user level by default.
          - You're using the Stable, Beta, or Dev channel, but when prompted for elevation when installing the elevation was canceled. When you cancel the elevation prompt, the installation will continue at the user level.
          - Internet Explorer 11 has been disabled in Windows Features.
          
          Possible solutions:
          
          - Run the installer for any channel at the system level: `installer.exe --system-level`.
          - Enable Internet Explorer 11 in Windows Features.
          
          To check if Microsoft Edge is installed at the systems level, type "edge://version" in the Microsoft Edge address bar. The Executable path will show a path starting with *C:\Program Files*, which indicates a system install. If the Executable path begins with *C:\Users\*, uninstall and then reinstall Microsoft Edge with administrator privileges.
      - question: 
          Can I test a site in Microsoft Edge while it is configured to open IE mode in the Enterprise Mode Site List?
        answer:
           Yes, while you are modernizing your legacy sites, you can test IE mode configured applications on Microsoft Edge. To accomplish this, you can run Microsoft Edge with the `--ie-mode-test` command line flag. Make sure that there are no other Microsoft Edge instances running.
         
           Then you can select Settings and more (the ellipses icon ...) > More Tools > Open sites in Edge mode.
      - question:

          Error message: "To open this page in IE mode, try restarting Microsoft Edge."
        answer: |
          You may see this error if there was an unexpected error in Internet Explorer. Restarting Microsoft Edge usually fixes this error.

      - question: |
          Error message: "Turn off remote debugging to open this site in IE mode otherwise it might not work as expected."
        answer: |
          You may see this error if you're remote debugging and navigate to a web page configured to run in IE mode. You can continue, but the page will be rendered using Microsoft Edge.

      - question: |
          Error message: "Error: Could not retrieve EMIE site list."
        answer: |
          You may see this error on the *edge://compat/enterprise* page indicating that the site list download failed. Starting with Microsoft Edge version 87, when cookies are blocked for third party requests using the [BlockThirdPartyCookies](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#blockthirdpartycookies) policy, HTTP authentication is also disallowed. You can allow cookies for the specific domain hosting your Enterprise Mode Site List using the [CookiesAllowedForURLs](./microsoft-edge-policies.md#cookiesallowedforurls) policy to ensure that site list downloads are successful.

      - question: |
          Will IE mode replace Internet Explorer 11?
        answer: |
          Yes, the Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022 (for a list of what’s in scope, [Lifecycle FAQ - Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17454/).The same IE11 apps and sites you use today can open in Microsoft Edge with Internet Explorer mode.

      - question: |
          How can I debug my legacy application while using IE mode on Microsoft Edge?
        answer: |
          You can use IEChooser to launch the Internet Explorer DevTools to debug the content of your IE mode tabs. To use IEChooser, perform the following steps.
          1. Open IEChooser.
              - Open the Run dialog box. For example, press the `Windows logo key` + `R`.
              - Enter `%systemroot%\system32\f12\IEChooser.exe`, and then select **Ok**.
          2. In IEChooser, select the entry for the IE mode tab.
            
      - question: |
          Can I use "Open with Explorer" or "View in File Explorer" in SharePoint with IE mode?
        answer: |
          Yes, if this works in standalone Internet Explorer 11 it will work in IE mode. However, rather than use the Open with Explorer option, the recommended approach to managing files and folders outside of SharePoint is to [sync your SharePoint files](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-sharepoint-files-with-the-onedrive-sync-app-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88) or [move or copy files in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-or-copy-files-in-sharepoint-00e2f483-4df3-46be-a861-1f5f0c1a87bc).
          
      - question: |
          Does IE mode on Microsoft Edge support the 'no-merge' option that was supported in Internet Explorer 11?
        answer: |
          The recommended alternatives for the no-merge functionality in Microsoft Edge are to -
          1. Use Profiles in Microsoft Edge - Each profile maps to a different IE session for IE mode pages, so it behaves identically to the *no-merge* option.
          2. Use the `--user-data-dir=<path>` command line, but with a different path for each session. If needed, you can create a utility for the user to run that both launches Microsoft Edge and changes the path for the session.
          
          If neither of those options work for your scenario, starting in **Microsoft Edge version 93**, IE mode on Microsoft Edge will support no-merge. For an end-user, when a new browser window is launched from an IE mode application, it will be in a separate session, like the no-merge behavior in IE11. 
          
          Behind the scenes, for each window of Microsoft Edge, the first time an IE mode tab is visited within that window, if it is one of the designated *“no-merge”* sites, that window is locked into a different “no-merge” IE session from all other Microsoft Edge windows at least until the last IE mode tab is closed in that window. 
          This follows previous behavior where users could launch IE with no-merge and could also launch Microsoft Edge without no-merge via other mechanisms. 
          All sites opening in a new window (through window.open) will respect the merge nature of the parent process. Please note that session switching isn’t supported;  navigations within the same IE mode tab will use the same session.
          
          You can validate the behavior in the Microsoft Edge **Beta** channel (version 93 or later) by following these steps:
          1. Ensure that IE mode is enabled on Microsoft Edge version 93 or later. 
          2. You can configure sites that need to prevent session sharing in the Enterprise Mode Site List by setting the value of the merge-type attribute to “no-merge”. This attribute is not applicable only when the open-in element is set to Microsoft Edge. By default, all sites have a merge-type value of merge. 
             (**Note**: The integrated site list manager tool available at edge://compat/sitelistmanager will include this option with the Microsoft Edge 93 *Stable* release)
          
             ```
             <site url="contoso.com">
             <open-in merge-type="no-merge">IE11</open-in>
             </site>
             ```
              
          3. Use the command line `--enable-features=msAllowNoMergeIEMode`. (**Note**: This command line currently exists for validation purposes and will not be necessary after the Microsoft Edge 93 *Stable* release)
          4. Navigate to any site configured as no-merge. The site should be in its own unmerged IE session. When you open another Microsoft Edge instance or window and navigate to the same site, it should be in its own IE session (notice multiple iexplore.exe processes in Task Manager).

      - question: |
          Can I save links as webpages in Internet Explorer mode?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can enable the Save Target As option in the context menu for Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge. To do this, configure the group policy *"Allow Save Target As in Internet Explorer mode"* located at *Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Internet Explorer*.
          The save mechanism works the same as it does in Internet Explorer and if the target is saved as an html file, re-opening the file will render the page in Microsoft Edge.
           
          Note that this functionality requires the following minimum operating system updates:
