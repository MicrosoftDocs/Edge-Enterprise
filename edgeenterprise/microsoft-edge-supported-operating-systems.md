# Microsoft Edge supported Operating Systems

This article describes the supported operating systems that apply to Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the Microsoft Edge versions 77 and higher for the desktop.

## Supported Operating Systems for Microsoft Edge

> [!NOTE]
> Product functionality and feature availability may vary on older operating systems. To ensure that Microsoft Edge installs correctly, use the latest version of any operating system specified below. This guidance includes the latest cumulative update, as applicable.


Microsoft Edge follows the Modern Lifecycle Policy and is supported on the following operating systems.

### Windows Client

- Windows 7 **
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10 SAC 1709 and later ***
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSC
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSC
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2019 LTSC
- Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session
- Windows 10 IoT Enterprise SAC ****
- Windows 10 IoT Enterprise 2019 LTSC ****

### Windows Server

- Windows Server 2008 R2 **
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016 (LTSC)
- Windows Server 2019 (LTSC)
- Windows Server (SAC)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ** We will continue to support Microsoft Edge on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 until January 15, 2022. These operating systems are out of support and Microsoft recommends you move to a supported operating system such as Windows 10. While Microsoft Edge helps keep you more secure on the web, your PC may still be vulnerable to security risks. In order for IE mode to be supported on these operating systems the devices will need to have the [Extended Security Updates for Windows 7](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7). Without the Windows 7 Extended Security updates Internet Explorer functionality will be vulnerable to security risks. Additionally, IE mode functionality may cease to work without the continued servicing through the extended security updates.  
>
> *** In the same fashion as above, for Windows 10 SAC releases that are out of support but Microsoft Edge is supported it is recommended to upgrade to a supported Win10 SAC release as soon as possible to remain secure. Microsoft Edge being supported in this state should be considered a temporary bridge to getting to a supported OS state.
>
> **** The Microsoft Edge OPK is available on MOO for IoT OEMs to preinstall and distribute as part of their Windows 10 IoT Enterprise based solution.
