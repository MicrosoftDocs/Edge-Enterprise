- Windows Server 2019 (LTSC)

- Windows Server (SAC)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ** We will continue to support Microsoft Edge on Windows 7 and on Windows Server 2008 R2 until January 15, 2023. These operating systems are out of support and Microsoft recommends you move to a supported operating system such as Windows 10. While Microsoft Edge helps keep you more secure on the web, your PC may still be vulnerable to security risks. In order for IE mode to be supported on these operating systems the devices will need to have the [Extended Security Updates for Windows 7](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7). Without the Windows 7 Extended Security updates Internet Explorer functionality will be vulnerable to security risks. Additionally, IE mode functionality may cease to work without the continued servicing through the extended security updates. Microsoft Edge on Windows 7 can be updated using the built-in auto update engine. Deploying Microsoft Edge updates with Configuration Manager and/or WSUS it is not supported.
>
> *** In the same fashion as above, for Windows 10 SAC releases that are out of support but Microsoft Edge is supported it is recommended to upgrade to a supported Win10 SAC release as soon as possible to remain secure. Microsoft Edge being supported in this state should be considered a temporary bridge to getting to a supported OS state.
>
> **** The Microsoft Edge OPK is available on MOO for IoT OEMs to preinstall and distribute as part of their Windows 10 IoT Enterprise based solution.
