# Cloud Site List Management for IE mode (Public Preview)

This article explains how to configure and use Cloud Site List Management for Internet Explorer (IE) mode through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (M365 Admin Center).

## Overview

As you transition your workflows and applications from IE11 to IE mode, **Cloud Site List Management** lets you manage your site lists for IE mode in the cloud. You can work with site lists using the **Microsoft Edge Site Lists** experience in the **M365 Admin Center**. 

**This experience is now in public preview.**

The preview experience lets you store your organization’s site list in a compliant cloud location instead of needing an on-premises infrastructure to host your site list. You can create, import, export site lists, and audit changes to site list entries through the M365 Admin Center. You can publish multiple site lists to the cloud and use group policy to assign different groups of devices to use different lists.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply to this public preview.

1. Customers must have an Azure AD tenant.
2. The tenant subscription must include Exchange Services. For more information, see the [FAQ](#faq).
3. Admins must have Microsoft Edge version 93 or greater installed and the latest version of the [policy files](https://aka.ms/edgeenterprise).
4. Admins need to be an [Edge Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#edge-administrator) or a [Global Administrator](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#global-administrator) on the tenant to access the **Microsoft Edge site lists** experience under **Org Settings** on M365 Admin Center.
   - Global Administrator permission is required to opt the tenant in to Targeted release for public preview. For more information, see [Opt in to public preview](#opt-in-to-public-preview).

## The preview experience

There are three aspects to the preview experience.

### Publish enterprise site list to the cloud

Admins can publish one or more site lists to an authenticated endpoint that Microsoft Edge clients within their tenant can download for the IE mode experience. Admins can import the existing enterprise site list XML into the Microsoft Edge Site Lists experience in the M365 Admin Center and then publish it to the cloud location. 

### Associate the cloud-hosted site list with Microsoft Edge

With Microsoft Edge version 93, admins can use the [InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationcloudsitelist) setting to configure one of the cloud-hosted site lists that Microsoft Edge can consume for IE mode. Users must be signed in to Microsoft Edge for the client to consume the site list from the cloud.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When this policy is configured, it overrides the original [InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy.

### Manage site list contents on the M365 Admin Center

Admins can create a new list or import an existing site list into the Microsoft Edge site lists experience. They can add, edit, delete site list contents, and view comment history to track changes to individual entries. The next section explains how to opt in to public preview and access the Microsoft Edge site lists experience in the M365 Admin Center.

## Opt in to public preview

While in public preview, you need to opt in to view preview experiences in the M365 Admin Center. You must be a global admin in Microsoft 365 to opt in.

Use the following steps to change how your organization receives Microsoft 365 updates.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take up to 24 hours for the following configuration changes to take effect in Microsoft 365. If you opt out of a targeted release after enabling it, your users may lose access to features that haven't reached the scheduled release yet.

## Associate the cloud-hosted site list with Microsoft Edge

Use the following steps to associate the cloud-hosted site list with Microsoft Edge.

1. To configure devices to use a published site list, click on the site list you want to assign to devices.
2. On the resulting page, copy the **Site list ID**.
3. For the device group you pick, select **Enabled** and enter the **Site list ID** in the [Configure the Enterprise Mode Cloud Site List](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#internetexplorerintegrationcloudsitelist) policy.
4. You can run **gpupdate/force** from  the Command Prompt to update the device with the policy or wait for the group policy to take effect. After the policy is updated, you can verify that Microsoft Edge is reading the cloud site list by going to [edge://compat/enterprise](edge://compat/enterprise). You need to be signed into Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> After publishing a site list the first time and updating group policy, you need to restart Microsoft Edge. Wait 60 seconds or select the Force Update button on [edge://compat/enterprise](edge://compat/enterprise). When publishing updates to an already associated site list, there may be an older version of the site list in the cache. This entry will be refreshed after 60 seconds. For more information, see [What happens if users log out of Microsoft Edge?](#what-happens-if-users-log-out-of-microsoft-edge).

## Manage site list contents on the M365 Admin Center

You can add individual site entries, delete site entries and view change history for comments.
If you have hybrid scenarios that require your site list to be hosted on-premises, you can export your site list from the M365 Admin Center. Use the following steps as a guide for managing site list content.

### Add individual sites to the site list

You can add individual sites to any site list. After adding sites to the list, you can use the predefined filters using the **Filter** button (next to the Search input area) to view updates to the list.

1. Go to the site list where you want to add a site.
2. Select **Add a site**.
3. Enter the site address and pick the engine that should be used to open the site. Add comments as needed and select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Status** column for any entries added to a Published site list will show **Addition pending**. If you navigate to the list of site lists by selecting **Microsoft Edge site lists** at the top of the screen, you'll see that the **Published Status** column shows **Changes pending publish** to indicate that latest updates to the site list need to be published in order for users to receive them. You can use the **Filter** button _(next to the Search box)_ to select Addition pending to see all added entries that are pending publication.

### View the change history for site entries

1. Select the site entry that you want to see the change history for and then select **View comments**.

### Delete a site from the site list

Use the following steps to delete a site entry.

1. Pick the site list entry that you’d like to delete a site from. Select **Delete site**.
2. Select **Delete** at the bottom of the pane.
3. After you see confirmation that a site entry has been deleted, it will stay on the list until the site list is published to the cloud location. You can view the list of deleted sites before publishing by selecting the Filter button and filtering for sites in the **Delete pending** state.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Status** column for any entries deleted from a Published site list will show **Delete pending**. If you navigate to the list of site lists by selecting **Microsoft Edge site lists** at the top of the screen, you'll see that the **Published Status** column shows **Changes pending publish** to indicate that latest updates to the site list need to be published in order for users to receive them.You can use the **Filter** button _(next to the Search box)_ to select Delete pending to see all deleted entries that are pending publication.

### Export a site list

There are scenarios where you want to export a site list. For example, if you're unable to move your site list to the cloud right away or if you need to maintain a hybrid environment with site lists in the cloud and on-premises. You can use the Cloud Site List Management experience to manage updates to a site list in a central location and export the site list to the on-premises host.

1. On the Microsoft Edge site lists page, select the site list that you want to export.
2. On the resulting page, you’ll see the site list entries and the **Export list** option.
3. Select **Export list** to download the site list XML file.

## FAQ

### Why is my tenant required to have an Exchange Service subscription for this feature?

This subscription ensures that the right backend association happens with your tenant immediately, which occurs when you first select Microsoft Edge site lists. When Exchange Services aren’t part of your subscription, the association request from the M365 Admin Center will fail. An alert is sent to the provisioning system to address the problem.  This will result in a three-day delay for you to use the experience.

### Can users who haven’t signed in to Microsoft Edge download the site list?

No, users must sign in to the browser to download the cloud hosted site list. You can configure a policy to allow Implicit Sign in to prevent user experience disruption. For more information, see [ImplicitSignInEnabled](/deployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#implicitsigninenabled).

### What is the default refresh interval after updates are made to site list contents?

The site list is refreshed in Microsoft Edge every two hours. You can change this interval the [NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#navigationdelayforinitialsitelistdownloadtimeout) policy. The minimum refresh interval is 30 minutes.

### What happens if users log out of Microsoft Edge?

Access to the site list requires explicit browser sign in for the first download. In a scenario where the user logs out after being logged in, the site list is cached in Microsoft Edge. The list will stay cached even if the user logs out of Microsoft Edge from their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account. Microsoft Edge will not try to fall back to the non-cloud download location while the Cloud site list policy is configured. Microsoft Edge attempts to update the cached site list at the following times (note that all attempts will fail if the user is not signed in to Microsoft Edge):

- 60 seconds after you restart the browser. If the 60 second startup delay needs to be shorter, you can use the [NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#navigationdelayforinitialsitelistdownloadtimeout) policy to change the amount of delay.
- Every two hours when Microsoft Edge is running.
