  ## Application Guard settings policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### ApplicationGuardContainerProxy

  #### Application Guard Container Proxy

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the proxy settings for Microsoft Edge Application Guard.
If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard ignores other sources of proxy configurations.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard uses the proxy configuration of the host.

This policy does not affect the proxy configuration of Microsoft Edge outside of Application Guard (on the host).

The ProxyMode field lets you specify the proxy server used by Microsoft Edge Application Guard.

The ProxyPacUrl field is a URL to a proxy .pac file.

The ProxyServer field is a URL for the proxy server.

If you choose the 'direct' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'auto_detect' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'fixed_servers' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyServer' field is used.

If you choose the 'pac_script' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyPacUrl' field is used.

For more information about identifying Application Guard traffic via dual proxy, visit [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134653](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134653).

  ## Content settings policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### AutoSelectCertificateForUrls

  #### Automatically select client certificates for these sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Setting the policy lets you make a list of URL patterns that specify sites for which Microsoft Edge can automatically select a client certificate. The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { "pattern": "$URL_PATTERN", "filter" : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { "ISSUER": { "CN": "$ISSUER_CN" } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the "ISSUER" and the "SUBJECT" sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with the "O" value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with a "OU" value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

If you leave the policy unset, there's no autoselection for any site.

  ### CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls

  #### Limit cookies from specific websites to the current session

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Cookies created by websites that match a URL pattern you define are deleted when the session ends (when the window closes).

Cookies created by websites that don't match the pattern are controlled by the [DefaultCookiesSetting](#defaultcookiessetting) policy (if set) or by the user's personal configuration. This is also the default behavior if you don't configure this policy.

If Microsoft Edge is running in background mode, the session might not close when the last window is closed, meaning the cookies won't be cleared when the window closes. See the [BackgroundModeEnabled](#backgroundmodeenabled) policy for information about configuring what happens when Microsoft Edge runs in background mode.

You can also use the [CookiesAllowedForUrls](#cookiesallowedforurls) and [CookiesBlockedForUrls](#cookiesblockedforurls) policies to control which websites can create cookies.

Note there cannot be conflicting URL patterns set between these three policies:

- [CookiesBlockedForUrls](#cookiesblockedforurls)

- [CookiesAllowedForUrls](#cookiesallowedforurls)

- CookiesSessionOnlyForUrls

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

If you set the [RestoreOnStartup](#restoreonstartup) policy to restore URLs from previous sessions, this policy is ignored, and cookies are stored permanently for those sites.

  Lets you revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on other configuration sources for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature. These features can also be configured by a field trial or the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag in edge://flags.

Policy options mapping:

* DefaultToLegacySameSiteCookieBehavior (1) = Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on all sites

* DefaultToSameSiteByDefaultCookieBehavior (2) = Use SameSite-by-default behavior for cookies on all sites

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList

  #### Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on specified sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

  #### Description

  Cookies set for domains match specified patterns will revert to legacy SameSite behavior.

Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the global default value will be used. The global default will also be used for cookies on domains not covered by the patterns you specify.

The global default value can be configured using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) policy. If [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) is unset, the global default value falls back to other configuration sources.

Note that patterns you list in this policy are treated as domains, not URLs, so you should not specify a scheme or port.

  ### WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls

  #### Grant access to specific sites to connect to specific USB devices

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of urls that specify which sites will automatically be granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list must contain both devices and urls in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site ("requesting URL") and the URL of the top-level frame site ("embedding URL") to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the "urls" field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in "urls" must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

If this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the [DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting](#defaultwebusbguardsetting) policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.

URL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via [WebUsbBlockedForUrls](#webusbblockedforurls). If there is a clash, this policy will take precedence over [WebUsbBlockedForUrls](#webusbblockedforurls) and [WebUsbAskForUrls](#webusbaskforurls).

You can specify the default search provider to use by enabling the rest of the default search policies. If these are left empty (not configured) or configured incorrectly, the user can choose the default provider.

If you disable this policy, the user can't search from the address bar.

If you enable or disable this policy, users can't change or override it.

If you don't configure this policy, the default search provider is enabled, and the user can choose the default search provider and set the search provider list.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX..

Starting in Microsoft Edge 84, you can set this policy as a recommended policy.

  ### ExtensionInstallBlocklist

  #### Control which extensions cannot be installed

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Lets you specify which extensions the users CANNOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. After a disabled extension is removed from the blocklist it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blocklist value of '\*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

If this policy isn't set, the user can install any extension in Microsoft Edge.

  ### ExtensionInstallForcelist

  #### Control which extensions are installed silently

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Set this policy to specify a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction. Users can't uninstall or turn off this setting. Permissions are granted implicitly, including the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. Note: These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.

If you don't set this policy, no apps or extensions are autoinstalled and users can uninstall any app in Microsoft Edge.

This policy supercedes [ExtensionInstallBlocklist](#extensioninstallblocklist) policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Microsoft Edge automatically uninstalls it.

On Microsoft Windows instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, and running Windows 10 Pro.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension can be altered by users with developer tools, potentially rendering the extension unfunctional. If this is a concern, configure the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on edge://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the "update" URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043) ). By default, the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website's update URL is used. The "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

Note: This policy doesn't apply to InPrivate mode. Read about hosting extensions (https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/enterprise/hosting-and-updating).

  ### ExtensionInstallSources

  #### Configure extension and user script install sources

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Define URLs that can install extensions and themes.

Define URLs that can install extensions and themes directly without having to drag and drop the packages to the edge://extensions page.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039)). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (in other words, the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns. Do not host the files at a location that requires authentication.

The [ExtensionInstallBlocklist](#extensioninstallblocklist) policy takes precedence over this policy. Any extensions that's on the block list won't be installed, even if it comes from a site on this list.

  ### ExtensionSettings

  #### Configure extension management settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Setting this policy controls extension management settings for Microsoft Edge, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. This policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID "*", which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest ( [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043) ).

To block extensions from a particular third party store, you only need to block the update_url for that store. For example, if you want to block extensions from Chrome Web Store, you can use the following JSON.

{"update_url:https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx":{"installation_mode":"blocked"}}

Note that you can still use [ExtensionInstallForcelist](#extensioninstallforcelist) and [ExtensionInstallAllowlist](#extensioninstallallowlist) to allow / force install specific extensions even if the store is blocked using the JSON in the previous example.

Note: For Windows instances not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.

  ### NativeMessagingAllowlist

  #### Control which native messaging hosts users can use

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 85 or later

  #### Description

  Allow Microsoft Edge to monitor user passwords.

If you enable this policy and a user consents to enabling the policy, the user will get alerted if any of their passwords stored in Microsoft Edge are found to be unsafe. Microsoft Edge will show an alert and this information will also be available in Settings > Passwords > Password Monitor.

If you disable this policy, users will not be asked for permission to enable this feature. Their passwords will not be scanned and they will not be alerted either.

If you enable or don't configure the policy, users can turn this feature on or off.

To learn more about how Microsoft Edge finds unsafe passwords see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133833](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2133833)

Additional guidance:

This policy can be set as both Recommended as well as Mandatory, however with an important callout.

Mandatory enabled: Given that individual user consent is a pre-condition to enabling this feature for a given user, this policy does not have a Mandatory enabled setting. If the policy is set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will not change and the following error message will be displayed in edge://policy

Example Error state message: "This policy value is ignored because Password Monitor requires the consent of the individual user for it to be turned on. You can ask users in your Organization to go to Settings > Profile > Password and turn on the feature."

Recommended enabled: If the policy is set to Recommended enabled, the UI in Settings will remain in 'Off' state, but a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "Your organization recommends a specific value for this setting and you have chosen a different value"

Mandatory and Recommended disabled: Both these states will work the normal way, with the usual captions being shown to users.

  ## Printing policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### DefaultPrinterSelection

  #### Default printer selection rules

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Overrides Microsoft Edge default printer selection rules. This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Microsoft Edge, which happens the first time a user tries to print a page.

When this policy is set, Microsoft Edge tries to find a printer that matches all of the specified attributes and uses it as default printer. If there are multiple printers that meet the criteria, the first printer that matches is used.

If you don't configure this policy or no matching printers are found within the timeout, the printer defaults to the built-in PDF printer or no printer, if the PDF printer isn't available.

The value is parsed as a JSON object, conforming to the following schema: { "type": "object", "properties": { "idPattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer id.", "type": "string" }, "namePattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer display name.", "type": "string" } } }

Omitting a field means all values match; for example, if you don't specify connectivity Print Preview starts discovering all kinds of local printers. Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensitive.

  ### NewTabPageCompanyLogo

  #### Set new tab page company logo (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 85.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79, until 85

  #### Description

  This policy didn't work as expected due to changes in operational requirements. Therefore it's obsolete and should not be used.

Specifies the company logo to use on the new tab page in Microsoft Edge.

The policy should be configured as a string that expresses the logo(s) in JSON format. For example: { "default_logo": { "url": "https://www.contoso.com/logo.png", "hash": "cd0aa9856147b6c5b4ff2b7dfee5da20aa38253099ef1b4a64aced233c9afe29" }, "light_logo": { "url": "https://www.contoso.com/light_logo.png", "hash": "517d286edb416bb2625ccfcba9de78296e90da8e32330d4c9c8275c4c1c33737" } }

You configure this policy by specifying the URL from which Microsoft Edge can download the logo and its cryptographic hash (SHA-256), which is used to verify the integrity of the download. The logo must be in PNG or SVG format, and its file size must not exceed 16 MB. The logo is downloaded and cached, and it will be redownloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The 'default_logo' is required and will be used when there's no background image. If 'light_logo' is provided, it will be used when the user's new tab page has a background image. We recommend a horizontal logo with a transparent background that is left-aligned and vertically centered. The logo should have a minimum height of 32 pixels and an aspect ratio from 1:1 to 4:1. The 'default_logo' should have proper contrast against a white/black background while the 'light_logo' should have proper contrast against a background image.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads and shows the specified logo(s) on the new tab page. Users can't override or hide the logo(s).

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will show no company logo or a Microsoft logo on the new tab page.

For help with determining the SHA-256 hash, see https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash.

  ### NewTabPageLocation

  #### Configure the new tab page URL

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the default URL for the new tab page.

The recommended version of this policy does not currently work and functions exactly like the mandatory version.

This policy determines the page that's opened when new tabs are created (including when new windows are opened). It also affects the startup page if that's set to open to the new tab page.

This policy doesn't determine which page opens on startup; that's controlled by the [RestoreOnStartup](#restoreonstartup) policy. It also doesn't affect the home page if that's set to open to the new tab page.

  ### NewTabPageManagedQuickLinks

  #### Set new tab page quick links

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

  #### Description

  By default, Microsoft Edge displays quick links on the new tab page from user-added shortcuts and top sites based on browsing history. With this policy, you can configure up to three quick link tiles on the new tab page, expressed as a JSON object:

[ { "url": "https://www.contoso.com", "title": "Contoso Portal", "pinned": true/false }, ... ]

The 'url' field is required; 'title' and 'pinned' are optional. If 'title' is not provided, the URL is used as the default title. If 'pinned' is not provided, the default value is false.

Microsoft Edge presents these in the order listed, from left to right, with all pinned tiles displayed ahead of non-pinned tiles.

If the policy is set as mandatory, the 'pinned' field will be ignored and all tiles will be pinned. The tiles can't be deleted by the user and will always appear at the front of the quick links list.

If the policy is set as recommended, pinned tiles will remain in the list but the user has the ability to edit and delete them. Quick link tiles that aren't pinned behave like default top sites and are pushed off the list if other websites are visited more frequently. When applying non-pinned links via this policy to an existing browser profile, the links may not appear at all, depending on how they rank compared to the user's browsing history.

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

  #### Description

  We are deprecating this policy because the new version of the enterprise new tab page no longer requires choosing between different content types. Instead, the content that is presented to the user can be controlled via the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Lets you choose either the Microsoft News or Office 365 feed experience for the new tab page.

When you set this policy to 'News', users will see the Microsoft News feed experience on the new tab page.

When you set this policy to 'Office', users with an Azure Active Directory browser sign-in will see the Office 365 feed experience on the new tab page.

If you disable or don't configure this policy:

- Users with an Azure Active Directory browser sign-in are offered the Office 365 new tab page feed experience, as well as the standard new tab page feed experience.

- Users without an Azure Active Directory browser sign-in will see the standard new tab page experience.

If you configure this policy *and* the [NewTabPageLocation](#newtabpagelocation) policy, [NewTabPageLocation](#newtabpagelocation) has precedence.

Default setting:  Disabled or not configured.

  ### AllowDeletingBrowserHistory

  #### Enable deleting browser and download history

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Enables deleting browser history and download history and prevents users from changing this setting.

Note that even with this policy is disabled, the browsing and download history aren't guaranteed to be retained: users can edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may remove (based on expiration period) or archive any or all history items at any time.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can delete the browsing and download history.

If you disable this policy, users can't delete browsing and download history, and history sync will be disabled.

If you enable this policy, don't enable the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy, because they both deal with deleting data. If you enable both, the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy takes precedence and deletes all data when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how this policy is configured.

  ### AudioSandboxEnabled

  #### Allow the audio sandbox to run

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls the audio process sandbox.

If you enable this policy, the audio process will run sandboxed.

If you disable this policy, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.

If you don't configure this policy, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which might differ based on the platform.

This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.

  ### AutoImportAtFirstRun

  #### Automatically import another browser's data and settings at first run

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable this policy, all supported datatypes and settings from the specified browser will be silently and automatically imported at first run. During the First Run Experience, the import section will also be skipped.

The browser data from Microsoft Edge Legacy will always be silently migrated at the first run, irrespective of the value of this policy.

If this policy is set to 'FromDefaultBrowser', then the datatypes corresponding to the default browser on the managed device will be imported.

If the browser specified as the value of this policy is not present in the managed device, Microsoft Edge will simply skip the import without any notification to the user.

If you set this policy to 'DisabledAutoImport', the import section of the first-run experience is skipped entirely and Microsoft Edge doesn't import browser data and settings automatically.

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromInternetExplorer', the following datatypes will be imported from Internet Explorer:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Search engines
4. Browsing history
5. Home page

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromGoogleChrome', the following datatypes will be imported from Google Chrome:
1. Favorites
2. Saved passwords
3. Addresses and more
4. Payment info
5. Browsing history
6. Settings
7. Pinned and Open tabs
8. Extensions
9. Cookies

Note: For more details on what is imported from Google Chrome, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120835](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120835)

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromSafari', user data is no longer imported into Microsoft Edge. This is due to the way Full Disk Access works on Mac.
On macOS Mojave and above, it's no longer possible to have automated and unattended import of Safari data into Microsoft Edge.

Starting with Microsoft Edge version 83, if this policy is set to the value of 'FromMozillaFirefox', the following datatypes will be imported from Mozilla Firefox:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Addresses and more
4. Browsing History

If you want to restrict specific datatypes from getting imported on the managed devices, you can use this policy with other policies such as [ImportAutofillFormData](#importautofillformdata), [ImportBrowserSettings](#importbrowsersettings), [ImportFavorites](#importfavorites), and etc.

Policy options mapping:

* FromDefaultBrowser (0) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from the default browser

* FromInternetExplorer (1) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Internet Explorer

* FromGoogleChrome (2) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Google Chrome

* FromSafari (3) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Safari

* DisabledAutoImport (4) = Disables automatic import, and the import section of the first-run experience is skipped

* FromMozillaFirefox (5) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Mozilla Firefox

  ### AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins

  #### Define a list of protocols that can launch an external application from listed origins without prompting the user

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns, that can launch an external application without prompting the user. The trailing separator should not be included when listing the protocol. For example, list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to launch an external application without prompting by policy if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch prompt will not be omitted by policy.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can launch without a prompt. Users can opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the [ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox](#externalprotocoldialogshowalwaysopencheckbox) policy is set to Disabled. This policy has no impact on per-protocol/per-site prompt exemptions set by users.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the [URLBlocklist](#urlblocklist) policy, which are documented at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

  ### AutoOpenFileTypes

  #### List of file types that should be automatically opened on download

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  This policy sets a list of file types that should be automatically opened on download. Note: The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list "txt" instead of ".txt".

By default, these file types will be automatically opened on all URLs. You can use the [AutoOpenAllowedForURLs](#autoopenallowedforurls) policy to restrict the URLs for which these file types will be automatically opened on.

Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

File types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will continue to do so when downloaded. The user will continue to be able to specify other file types to be automatically opened.

If you don't set this policy, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  ### BrowserSignin

  #### Browser sign-in settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specify whether a user can sign into Microsoft Edge with their account and use account-related services like sync and single sign on. To control the availability of sync, use the [SyncDisabled](#syncdisabled) policy instead.

If you set this policy to 'Disable', make sure that you also set the [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) policy to disabled because [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) disables the creation of an automatically signed in browser profile. If both policies are set, Microsoft Edge will use the 'Disable browser sign-in' policy and behave as if [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) is set to disabled.

If you set this policy to 'Enable', users can sign into the browser. Signing into the browser doesn't mean that sync is turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature.

If you set this policy to 'Force', users must sign into a profile to use the browser. By default, this will allow the user to choose whether they want to sync to their account, unless sync is disabled by the domain admin or with the [SyncDisabled](#syncdisabled) policy. The default value of [BrowserGuestModeEnabled](#browserguestmodeenabled) policy is set to false.

If you don't configure this policy users can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit.

Policy options mapping:

* Disable (0) = Disable browser sign-in

* Enable (1) = Enable browser sign-in

* Force (2) = Force users to sign-in to use the browser

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### BrowsingDataLifetime

  #### Browsing Data Lifetime Settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 89 or later

  #### Description

  Configures browsing data lifetime settings for Microsoft Edge.
This policy controls the lifetime of selected browsing data. This policy has no effect if Sync is enabled.
The available data types are the 'browsing_history', 'download_history', 'cookies_and_other_site_data', 'cached_images_and_files', 'password_signin', 'autofill', 'site_settings' and 'hosted_app_data'.
Microsoft Edge will regularly remove data of selected types that is older than 'time_to_live_in_hours'. Because data deletion only happens at certain intervals, some data might be kept slightly longer but never more than twice its expected 'time_to_live_in_hours'.

  ### BuiltInDnsClientEnabled

  #### Use built-in DNS client

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether to use the built-in DNS client.

This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the operating system DNS client, or Microsoft Edge's built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Microsoft Edge always uses the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

If you enable this policy, the built-in DNS client is used, if it's available.

If you disable this policy, the built-in DNS client is only used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.

If you don't configure this policy, the built-in DNS client is enabled by default.

  ### BuiltinCertificateVerifierEnabled

  #### Determines whether the built-in certificate verifier will be used to verify server certificates (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because it's intended to serve only as a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their environments and report issues if they are found to be incompatible with the built-in certificate verifier.

It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 87, when support for the legacy certificate verifier on Mac OS X is planned to be removed.

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcement of Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed to still be used for Enterprise hosts.

To disable Certificate Transparency enforcement when this policy is set, one of the following sets of conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the "/" character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is "sha256".

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

  #### Supported features:

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of legacy certificate authorities

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of legacy certificate authorities (Cas).

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed, continue to be used for enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled, you must set the hash to a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a legacy certificate authority (CA). A legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default by one or more operating systems supported by Microsoft Edge.

You specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the "/" character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is "sha256".

If you don't configure this policy, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it isn't disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for specific URLs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for the listed URLs.

This policy lets you not disclose certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs via Certificate Transparency. This lets you use certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they weren't properly publicly disclosed, but it makes it harder to detect mis-issued certificates for those hosts.

Form your URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). Because certificates are valid for a given hostname, independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname part of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If you don't configure this policy, any certificate that should be disclosed via Certificate Transparency is treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed.

  ### ClearBrowsingDataOnExit

  #### Clear browsing data when Microsoft Edge closes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  Microsoft Edge doesn't clear the browsing data by default when it closes. Browsing data includes information entered in forms, passwords, and even the websites visited.

If you enable this policy, all browsing data is deleted each time Microsoft Edge closes. Note that if you enable this policy, it takes precedence over how you configured [DefaultCookiesSetting](#defaultcookiessetting)

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can configure the Clear browsing data option in Settings.

If you enable this policy, don't configure the [AllowDeletingBrowserHistory](#allowdeletingbrowserhistory) or the [ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit](#clearcachedimagesandfilesonexit) policy, because they all deal with deleting browsing data. If you configure the preceding policies and this policy, all browsing data is deleted when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how you configured [AllowDeletingBrowserHistory](#allowdeletingbrowserhistory) or [ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit](#clearcachedimagesandfilesonexit).

To exclude cookies from being deleted on exit, configure the [SaveCookiesOnExit](#savecookiesonexit) policy.

  ### ClickOnceEnabled

  #### Allow users to open files using the ClickOnce protocol

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78 or later

  #### Description

  Allow users to open files using the ClickOnce protocol. The ClickOnce protocol allows websites to request that the browser open files from a specific URL using the ClickOnce file handler on the user's computer or device.

If you enable this policy, users can open files using the ClickOnce protocol. This policy overrides the user's ClickOnce setting in the edge://flags/ page.

If you disable this policy, users can't open files using the ClickOnce protocol. Instead, the file will be saved to the file system using the browser. This policy overrides the user's ClickOnce setting in the edge://flags/ page.

If you don't configure this policy, users with Microsoft Edge versions before Microsoft Edge 87 can't open files using the ClickOnce protocol by default. However, they have the option to enable the use of the ClickOnce protocol with the edge://flags/ page. Users with Microsoft Edge versions 87 and later can open files using the ClickOnce protocol by default but have the option to disable the ClickOnce protocol with edge://flags/ page.

Disabling ClickOnce may prevent ClickOnce applications (.application files) from launching properly.

For more information about ClickOnce, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103872](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103872) and [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099880](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099880).

  ### CommandLineFlagSecurityWarningsEnabled

  #### Enable security warnings for command-line flags

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  If disabled, this policy prevents security warnings from appearing when Microsoft Edge is launched with potentially dangerous command-line flags.

If enabled or unset, security warnings are displayed when these command-line flags are used to launch Microsoft Edge.

For example, the --disable-gpu-sandbox flag generates this warning:  You're using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-gpu-sandbox. This poses stability and security risks.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  ### ConfigureFriendlyURLFormat

  #### Configure the default paste format of URLs copied from Microsoft Edge, and determine if additional formats will be available to users

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 87 or later
  - On macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  If FriendlyURLs are enabled, Microsoft Edge will compute additional representations of the URL and place them on the clipboard.

This policy configures what format will be pasted when the user pastes in external applications, or inside Microsoft Edge without the 'Paste as' context menu item.

If configured, this policy makes a choice on behalf of the user. The options in edge://settings/shareCopyPaste will be grayed out, and the options in the 'Paste As' context menu will not be available.

* Not configured = The user will be able to choose their preferred paste format. By default, this is set to the friendly URL format. The 'Paste As' menu will be available in Microsoft Edge.

* 1 = No additional formats will be stored on the clipboard. There will be no 'Paste as' context menu item in Microsoft Edge and the only format available to paste will be the plain text URL format. Effectively, the friendly URL feature will be disabled.

* 3 = The user will get a friendly URL whenever they paste into surfaces that accept rich text. The plain URL will still be available for non-rich surfaces. There will be no 'Paste As' menu in Microsoft Edge.

* 4 = (Not currently used)

The richer formats may not be well-supported in some paste destinations and/or websites. As such, if this policy is to be configured, then the plain URL option is recommended.

Policy options mapping:

* PlainText (1) = The plain URL without any extra information, such as the page's title. This is the recommended option when this policy is configured. For more information, see the description.

* TitledHyperlink (3) = Titled Hyperlink: A hyperlink that points to the copied URL, but whose visible text is the title of the destination page. This is the Friendly URL format.

* WebPreview (4) = Coming soon. If set, behaves the same as 'Plain URL'.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### ConfigureOnPremisesAccountAutoSignIn

  #### Configure automatic sign in with an Active Directory domain account when there is no Azure AD domain account

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 81 or later

  #### Description

  Enable the use of Active Directory accounts for automatic sign in if your users' machines are Domain Joined and your environment is not hybrid joined. If you want users automatically signed in with their Azure Active Directory accounts instead, please Azure AD join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197) for more information) or hybrid join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365) for more information) your environment.

On every launch, Microsoft Edge will try to sign-in using this policy, as long as the first profile being launched isn't signed-in or an auto sign-in hasn't happened before.

If you have configured the [BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) policy to disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable', Microsoft Edge will automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines using their Active Directory accounts.

If you set this policy to 'Disabled' or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will not automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines with Active Directory accounts.

From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with sync disabled and machine is now hybrid joined i.e it has an Azure AD account, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile to get full Azure AD sync facilities.

Policy options mapping:

* Disabled (0) = Disabled

* SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable (1) = Sign in and make domain account non-removable

  #### DNS interception checks enabled

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures a local switch that can be used to disable DNS interception checks. These checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

This detection might not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known. It can be disabled to avoid additional DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

  ### DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled

  #### Set Microsoft Edge as default browser

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows 7 and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  If you set this policy to True, Microsoft Edge always checks whether it's the default browser on startup and, if possible, automatically registers itself.

If you set this policy to False, Microsoft Edge is stopped from ever checking if it's the default and turns user controls off for this option.

If you don't set this policy, Microsoft Edge lets users control whether it's the default and, if not, whether user notifications should appear.

Note for Windows administrators: This policy only works for PCs running Windows 7. For later versions of Windows, you have to deploy a "default application associations" file that makes Microsoft Edge the handler for the https and http protocols (and, optionally, the ftp protocol and file formats such as .html, .htm, .pdf, .svg, .webp).

  #### Description

  Configures the language variants that Microsoft Edge sends to websites as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header and prevents users from adding, removing, or changing the order of preferred languages in Microsoft Edge settings. Users who want to change the languages Microsoft Edge displays in or offers to translate pages to will be limited to the languages configured in this policy.

If you enable this policy, websites will appear in the first language in the list that they support unless other site-specific logic is used to determine the display language. The language variants defined in this policy override the languages configured as part of the [SpellcheckLanguage](#spellchecklanguage) policy.

If you don't configure or disable this policy, Microsoft Edge sends websites the user-specified preferred languages as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header.

For detailed information on valid language variants, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854).

  ### DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload

  #### Require that the Enterprise Mode Site List is available before tab navigation

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Lets you specify whether Microsoft Edge tabs wait to navigate until the browser has downloaded the initial Enterprise Mode Site List. This setting is intended for the scenario where the browser home page should load in Internet Explorer mode, and it is important that is does so on browser first run after IE mode is enabled. If this scenario does not exist, we recommend not enabling this setting because it can negatively impact the performance of loading the home page. The setting only applies when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached Enterprise Mode Site List, such as on browser first run after IE mode is enabled.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

The timeout behavior of this policy can be configured with the [NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout](#navigationdelayforinitialsitelistdownloadtimeout) policy.

If you set this policy to 'All', when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs delay navigating until the browser has downloaded the site list. Sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode by the site list will load in Internet Explorer mode, even during the initial navigation of the browser. Sites that cannot possibly be configured to open in Internet Explorer, such as any site with a scheme other than http:, https:, file:, or ftp: do not delay navigating and load immediately in Edge mode.

If you set this policy to 'None' or don't configure it, when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs will navigate immediately, and not wait for the browser to download the Enterprise Mode Site List. Sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode by the site list will open in Microsoft Edge mode until the browser has finished downloading the Enterprise Mode Site List.

Policy options mapping:

* None (0) = None

* All (1) = All eligible navigations

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  #### Allow users to open files using the DirectInvoke protocol

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78 or later

  #### Description

  Allow users to open files using the DirectInvoke protocol. The DirectInvoke protocol allows websites to request that the browser open files from a specific URL using a specific file handler on the user's computer or device.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, users can open files using the DirectInvoke protocol.

  ### DiskCacheDir

  #### Set disk cache directory

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the directory to use to store cached files.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided directory regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-dir' flag. To avoid data loss or other unexpected errors, don't configure this policy to a volume's root directory or to a directory used for other purposes, because Microsoft Edge manages its contents.

See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041) for a list of variables you can use when specifying directories and paths.

If you don't configure this policy, the default cache directory is used, and users can override that default with the '--disk-cache-dir' command line flag.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart

  ### DiskCacheSize

  #### Set disk cache size, in bytes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the size of the cache, in bytes, used to store files on the disk.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided cache size regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-size' flag. The value specified in this policy isn't a hard boundary but rather a suggestion to the caching system; any value below a few megabytes is too small and will be rounded up to a reasonable minimum.

If you set the value of this policy to 0, the default cache size is used, and users can't change it.

If you don't configure this policy, the default size is used, but users can override it with the '--disk-cache-size' flag.

  #### Supported features:

  ### DnsOverHttpsMode

  #### Control the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  Control the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query. The mode can be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

The "off" mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

The "automatic" mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

The "secure" mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

If you don't configure this policy, the browser might send DNS-over-HTTPS requests to a resolver associated with the user's configured system resolver.

Policy options mapping:

* off (off) = Disable DNS-over-HTTPS

* automatic (automatic) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS with insecure fallback

* secure (secure) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS without insecure fallback

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  #### Specify URI template of desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  The URI template of the desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. To specify multiple DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers, separate the corresponding URI templates with spaces.

If you set [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) to "secure" then this policy must be set and cannot be empty.

If you set [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) to "automatic" and this policy is set then the URI templates specified will be used. If you don't set this policy, then hardcoded mappings will be used to attempt to upgrade the user's current DNS resolver to a DoH resolver operated by the same provider.

If the URI template contains a dns variable, requests to the resolver will use GET; otherwise requests will use POST.

Incorrectly formatted templates will be ignored.

  ### EnableDomainActionsDownload

  #### Enable Domain Actions Download from Microsoft (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 84.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77, until 84

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because conflicting states should be avoided. This policy was used to enable/disable download of the domain actions list, but it didn't always achieve the desired state. The Experimentation and Configuration Service, which handles the download, has its own policy to configure what is downloaded from the service. Use the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy instead.

In Microsoft Edge, Domain Actions represent a series of compatibility features that help the browser work correctly on the web.

Microsoft keeps a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.

When the browser starts up and then periodically afterwards, the browser will contact the Experimentation and Configuration Service that contains the most up to date list of compatibility actions to perform. This list is saved locally after it is first retrieved so that subsequent requests will only update the list if the server's copy has changed.

If you enable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

If you disable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will no longer be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

If you don't configure this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

  ### EnableOnlineRevocationChecks

  #### Enable online OCSP/CRL checks

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Online revocation checks don't provide a significant security benefit and are disabled by default.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will perform soft-fail, online OCSP/CRL checks. "Soft fail" means that if the revocation server can't be reached, the certificate will be considered valid.

If you disable the policy or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge won't perform online revocation checks.

  ### EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors

  #### Allow certificates signed using SHA-1 when issued by local trust anchors (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  When this setting is enabled, Microsoft Edge allows connections secured by SHA-1 signed certificates so long as the the certificate chains to a locally-installed root certificate and is otherwise valid.

Note that this policy depends on the operating system (OS) certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy might no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1. This policy will be removed in Microsoft Edge 92 releasing in mid 2021.

If you don't set this policy or set it to false, or the SHA-1 certificate chains to a publicly trusted certificate root, then Microsoft Edge won't allow certificates signed by SHA-1.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  ### ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings

  #### Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  You can enable this policy to create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from file type extension-based download warnings. This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the "jnlp" extension is associated with "website1.com", users would not see a warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website1.com", but see a download warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website2.com".

Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.

If you enable this policy:

* The URL pattern should be formatted according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).
* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list "jnlp" should be used instead of ".jnlp".

Example:

The following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.

[
  { "file_extension": "jnlp", "domains": ["contoso.com"] },
  { "file_extension": "exe", "domains": ["contoso.com"] },
  { "file_extension": "swf", "domains": ["*"] }
]

Note that while the preceding example shows the suppression of file type extension-based download warnings for "swf" files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains for any dangerous file type extension is not recommended due to security concerns. It is shown in the example merely to demonstrate the ability to do so.

  ### ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl

  #### Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  In Microsoft Edge, the Experimentation and Configuration Service is used to deploy Experimentation and Configuration payload.

Experimentation payload consists of a list of early in development features that Microsoft is enabling for testing and feedback.

Configuration payload consists of a list of settings that Microsoft wants to deploy to Microsoft Edge to optimize user experience. For example, configuration payload may specify how often Microsoft Edge sends requests to the Experimentation and Configuration Service to retrieve the newest payload.

Additionaly, configuration payload may also contain a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.

If you set this policy to 'FullMode', the full payload is downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service. This includes both the experimentation and configuration payloads.

If you set this policy to 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode', only the configuration payload is delivered.

If you set this policy to 'RestrictedMode', the communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service is stopped completely.

If you don't configure this policy, on a managed device on Stable and Beta channels the behavior is the same as the 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode'.

If you don't configure this policy, on an unmanaged device the behavior is the same as the 'FullMode'.

Policy options mapping:

* FullMode (2) = Retrieve configurations and experiments

* ConfigurationsOnlyMode (1) = Retrieve configurations only

* RestrictedMode (0) = Disable communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### ForceEphemeralProfiles

  #### Enable use of ephemeral profiles

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether user profiles are switched to ephemeral mode. An ephemeral profile is created when a session begins, is deleted when the session ends, and is associated with the user's original profile.

If you enable this policy, profiles run in ephemeral mode. This lets users work from their own devices without saving browsing data to those devices. If you enable this policy as an OS policy (by using GPO on Windows, for example), it applies to every profile on the system.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, users get their regular profiles when they sign in to the browser.

In ephemeral mode, profile data is saved on disk only for the length of the user session. Features like browser history, extensions and their data, web data like cookies, and web databases aren't saved after the browser is closed. This doesn't prevent a user from manually downloading any data to disk, or from saving pages or printing them. If the user has enabled sync, all data is preserved in their sync accounts just like with regular profiles. Users can also use InPrivate browsing in ephemeral mode unless you explicitly disable this.

  ### ForceLegacyDefaultReferrerPolicy

  #### Use a default referrer policy of no-referrer-when-downgrade (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 88.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81, until 88

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content if it was found to be incompatible with the new default referrer policy.

Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy was strengthened from the value of no-referrer-when-downgrade to the more secure strict-origin-when-cross-origin.

When this enterprise policy is enabled, Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy will be set to its old value of no-referrer-when-downgrade.

This enterprise policy is disabled by default.

  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 83.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78, until 83

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to migrate to 3rd party software that doesn't depend on hooking networking APIs. Proxy servers are recommended over LSPs and Win32 API patching.

This policy forces networking code to run in the browser process.

This policy is disabled by default. If enabled, users are open to security issues when the networking process is sandboxed.

  ### GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled

  #### Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If you disable or don't set this policy, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site. So, if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If you enable this policy HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another site.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures and will be removed in the future.

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes

  ### GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar

  #### Force direct intranet site navigation instead of searching on single word entries in the Address Bar

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable this policy, the top auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will navigate to intranet sites if the text entered in the address bar is a single word without punctuation.

Default navigation when typing a single word without punctuation will conduct a navigation to an intranet site matching the entered text.

If you enable this policy, the second auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will conduct a web search exactly as it was entered, provided that this text is a single word without punctuation. The default search provider will be used unless a policy to prevent web search is also enabled.

Two effects of enabling this policy are:

Navigation to sites in response to single word queries that would typically resolve to a history item will no longer happen. Instead, the browser will attempt navigate to internal sites that may not exist in an organization's intranet. This will result in a 404 error.

Popular, single-word search terms will require manual selection of search suggestions to properly conduct a search.

  ### IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled

  #### Control the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  When enabled the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature causes Javascript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced, running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5 minutes or more.

This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

If you enable this policy, the feature will be force enabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you disable this policy, the feature will be force disabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you don't configure this policy, the feature will be controlled by its own internal logic. Users can manually configure this setting.

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full restart is required to ensure that all the loaded tabs receive a consistent policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different values of this policy.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationEnhancedHangDetection

  #### Configure enhanced hang detection for Internet Explorer mode

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Enhanced hang detection is a more granular approach to detecting hung webpages in Internet Explorer mode than what standalone Internet Explorer uses. When a hung webpage is detected, the browser will apply a mitigation to prevent the rest of the browser from hanging.

This setting allows you to configure the use of enhanced hang detection in case you run into incompatible issues with any of your websites. We recommend disabling this policy only if you see notifications such as "(website) is not responding" in Internet Explorer mode but not in standalone Internet Explorer.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

If you set this policy to 'Enabled' or don't configure it, websites running in Internet Explorer mode will use enhanced hang detection.

If you set this policy to 'Disabled', enhanced hang detection is disabled, and users will get the basic Internet Explorer hang detection behavior.

To learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094210](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094210)

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteRedirect

  #### Specify how "in-page" navigations to unconfigured sites behave when started from Internet Explorer mode pages

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 81 or later

  #### Description

  An "in-page" navigation is started from a link, a script, or a form on the current page. It can also be a server-side redirect of a previous "in-page" navigation attempt. Conversely, a user can start a navigation that isn't "in-page" that's independent of the current page in several ways by using the browser controls. For example, using the address bar, the back button, or a favorite link.

This setting lets you specify whether navigations from pages loaded in Internet Explorer mode to unconfigured sites (that are not configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List) switch back to Microsoft Edge or remain in Internet Explorer mode.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, only sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will open in that mode. Any site not configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will be redirected back to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'Default', only sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will open in that mode. Any site not configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will be redirected back to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'AutomaticNavigationsOnly', you get the default experience except that all automatic navigations (such as 302 redirects) to unconfigured sites will be kept in Internet Explorer mode.

If you set this policy to 'AllInPageNavigations', all navigations from pages loaded in IE mode to unconfigured sites are kept in Internet Explorer mode (Least Recommended).

To learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2105106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2105106)

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationTestingAllowed

  #### Allow Internet Explorer mode testing

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 86 or later

  #### Description

  This policy allows users to test applications in Internet Explorer mode by opening an Internet Explorer mode tab in Microsoft Edge.

Users can do so from within the "More tools" menu by selecting 'Open sites in Internet Explorer mode'.

Additionally, users can test their applications in a modern browser without removing applications from the site list using the option 'Open sites in Edge mode'.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

If you enable this policy, the option to 'Open sites in Internet Explorer mode' will be visible under "More tools". Users can view their sites in Internet Explorer mode on this tab. Another option to 'Open sites in Edge mode' will also be visible under "More tools" to help testing sites in a modern browser without removing them from the site list.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can't see the options 'Open in Internet Explorer mode' and 'Open in Edge mode' under "More tools" menu. However, users can configure these options with the --ie-mode-test flag.

  ### IntranetRedirectBehavior

  #### Intranet Redirection Behavior

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures behavior for intranet redirection via DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

If this policy isn't configured, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

[DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled](#dnsinterceptionchecksenabled) is a related policy that might also disable DNS interception checks. However, this policy is a more flexible version which might separately control intranet redirection infobars and might be expanded in the future.
If either [DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled](#dnsinterceptionchecksenabled) or this policy make a request to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.
If DNS interception checks are disabled by this policy but [GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar](#gotointranetsiteforsinglewordentryinaddressbar) is enabled, single word queries will still result in intranet navigations.

Policy options mapping:

* Default (0) = Use default browser behavior.

* DisableInterceptionChecksDisableInfobar (1) = Disable DNS interception checks and did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

* DisableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (2) = Disable DNS interception checks; allow did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

* EnableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (3) = Allow DNS interception checks and did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### IsolateOrigins

  #### Enable site isolation for specific origins

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specify origins to run in isolation, in their own process.

This policy also isolates origins named by subdomains - for example, specifying https://contoso.com/ will cause https://foo.contoso.com/ to be isolated as part of the https://contoso.com/ site.

If the policy is enabled, each of the named origins in a comma-separated list will run in its own process.

If you disable this policy, then both the 'IsolateOrigins' and 'SitePerProcess' features are disabled. Users can still enable 'IsolateOrigins' policy manually, via command line flags.

If you don't configure the policy, the user can change this setting.

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  Allow suggestions from suggestion providers on the device (local providers), for example, Favorites and Browsing History, in Microsoft Edge's Address Bar and Auto-Suggest List.

If you enable this policy, suggestions from local providers are used.

If you disable this policy, suggestions from local providers are never used. Local history and local favorites suggestions will not appear.

If you do not configure this policy, suggestions from local providers are allowed but the user can change that using the settings toggle.

Note that some features may not be available if a policy to disable this feature has been applied. For example, Browsing History suggestions will not be available if you enable the [SavingBrowserHistoryDisabled](#savingbrowserhistorydisabled) policy.

This policy requires a browser restart to finish applying.

  ### ManagedFavorites

  #### Configure favorites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures a list of managed favorites.

The policy creates a list of favorites. Each favorite contains the keys "name" and "url," which hold the favorite's name and its target. You can configure a subfolder by defining a favorites without an "url" key but with an additional "children" key that contains a list of favorites as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Microsoft Edge amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Address Bar, for example "microsoft.com" becomes "https://microsoft.com/".

These favorites are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the favorites bar). By default the folder name is "Managed favorites" but you can change it by adding to the list of favorites a dictionary containing the key "toplevel_name" with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed favorites are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.

  ### ManagedSearchEngines

  #### Manage Search Engines

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Lets you configure a list of up to 10 search engines, one of which must be marked as the default search engine.
You do not need to specify the encoding. Starting in Microsoft Edge 80, the suggest_url and image_search_url parameters are optional. The optional parameter, image_search_post_params (consists of comma-separated name/value pairs), is available starting in Microsoft Edge 80.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 83, you can enable search engine discovery with the allow_search_engine_discovery optional parameter. This parameter must be the first item in the list. If allow_search_engine_discovery is not specified, search engine discovery will be disabled by default. Starting in Microsoft Edge 84, you can set this policy as a recommended policy to allow search provider discovery. You do not need to add the allow_search_engine_discovery optional parameter.

If you enable this policy, users can't add, remove, or change any search engine in the list. Users can set their default search engine to any search engine in the list.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can modify the search engines list as desired.

If the [DefaultSearchProviderSearchURL](#defaultsearchprovidersearchurl) policy is set, this policy (ManagedSearchEngines) is ignored. The user must restart their browser to finish applying this policy.

  ### MaxConnectionsPerProxy

  #### Maximum number of concurrent connections to the proxy server

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server.

Some proxy servers can't handle a high number of concurrent connections per client - you can solve this by setting this policy to a lower value.

The value of this policy should be lower than 100 and higher than 6. The default value is 32.

Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs - lowering the maximum connections below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if too many of these kind of web apps are open.

If you don't configure this policy, the default value (32) is used.

  ### MetricsReportingEnabled

  #### Enable usage and crash-related data reporting (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 88.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77, until 88

  #### Description

  This policy is no longer supported. It is replaced by [DiagnosticData](#diagnosticdata) (for Windows 7, Windows 8, and macOS) and Allow Telemetry on Win 10 ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099569](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099569)).

This policy enables reporting of usage and crash-related data about Microsoft Edge to Microsoft.

Enable this policy to send reporting of usage and crash-related data to Microsoft. Disable this policy to not send the data to Microsoft. In both cases, users can't change or override the setting.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will only send usage data if the Windows Diagnostic data setting is set to Enhanced or Full. If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will not send usage data. Crash-related data is sent based on the Windows Diagnostic data setting. Learn more about Windows Diagnostic data settings at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099569](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099569)

On Windows 7, Windows 8, and macOS, this policy controls sending usage and crash-related data. If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will default to the user's preference.

To enable this policy,[SendSiteInfoToImproveServices](#sendsiteinfotoimproveservices) must be set to Enabled. If [MetricsReportingEnabled](#metricsreportingenabled) or [SendSiteInfoToImproveServices](#sendsiteinfotoimproveservices) is Not Configured or Disabled, this data will not be sent to Microsoft.

  Allows you to set a timeout, in seconds, for Microsoft Edge tabs waiting to navigate until the browser has downloaded the initial Enterprise Mode Site List.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry
and
[DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload](#delaynavigationsforinitialsitelistdownload) is set to "All eligible navigations" (1).

Tabs will not wait longer than this timeout for the Enterprise Mode Site List to download. If the browser has not finished downloading the Enterprise Mode Site List when the timeout expires, Microsoft Edge tabs will continue navigating anyway. The value of the timeout should be no greater than 20 seconds and no fewer than 1 second.

If you set the timeout in this policy to a value greater than the default of 2 seconds, an information bar is shown to the user after 2 seconds. The information bar contains a button that allows the user to quit waiting for the Enterprise Mode Site List download to complete.

If you don't configure this policy, the default timeout of 2 seconds is used. This default is subject to change in the future.

  ### NonRemovableProfileEnabled

  #### Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78 or later

  #### Description

  This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account.

If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. The profile will be non-removable only if profile is signed-in with either on-premises account or Azure AD account that matches OS sign-in account.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user.

If you want to configure browser sign in, use the [BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) policy.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management.

From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with sync disabled and machine is hybrid joined, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile and make it non-removable instead of creating a new non-removable Azure AD profile.

  ### OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin

  #### Control where security restrictions on insecure origins apply

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (like "*.contoso.com") for which security restrictions on insecure origins don't apply.

This policy lets you specify allowed origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development so that developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If you enable this policy, it overrides the command-line flag.

For more information on secure contexts, see https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 87 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you specify whether Internet Explorer will redirect navigations to sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge.

If you don't configure this policy or set it to 'Sitelist', beginning in M87, Internet Explorer will redirect sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge.

When a site is redirected from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge, the Internet Explorer tab that began loading that site is closed if it had no prior content. Otherwise, it is navigated to a Microsoft help page explaining why the site was redirected to Microsoft Edge.

When Microsoft Edge is launched to load a site from IE, an information bar is shown to the user explaining that the site works best in a modern browser.

If you set this policy to 'Disable', Internet Explorer will not redirect any traffic to Microsoft Edge.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge adds a recycle icon at the far right of the top menu bar to prompt users to restart the browser to apply the update.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'Recommended', a recurring warning prompts users that a restart is recommended. Users can dismiss this warning and defer the restart.

If you set the policy to 'Required', a recurring warning prompts users that the browser will be restarted automatically as soon as a notification period passes. The default period is seven days. You can configure this period with the [RelaunchNotificationPeriod](#relaunchnotificationperiod) policy.

The user's session is restored when the browser restarts.

If you enable this policy, a web service is used for network connectivity tests.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses native APIs to try to resolve network connectivity and navigation issues.

**Note**: Except on Windows 8 and later versions of Windows, Microsoft Edge *always* uses native APIs to resolve connectivity issues.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge respects the user preference that's set under Services at edge://settings/privacy.
Specifically, there's a **Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors** toggle, which the user can switch on or off. Be aware that if you have enabled this policy (ResolveNavigationErrorsUseWebService), the **Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors** setting is turned on, but the user can't change the setting by using the toggle. If you have disabled this policy, the **Use a web service to help resolve navigation errors** setting is turned off, and the user can't change the setting by using the toggle.

  ### TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled

  #### Enable a TLS 1.3 security feature for local trust anchors (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 85.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81, until 85

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to upgrade affected proxies.

This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 that protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.

If you enable this policy or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will enable these security protections for all connections.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.

This policy can be used to test for any affected proxies and upgrade them. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes

  #### Data Type:

  ### TLSCipherSuiteDenyList

  #### Specify the TLS cipher suites to disable

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  Configure the list of cipher suites that are disabled for TLS connections.

If you configure this policy, the list of configured cipher suites will not be used when establishing TLS connections.

If you don't configure this policy, the browser will choose which TLS cipher suites to use.

Cipher suite values to be disabled are specified as 16-bit hexadecimal values. The values are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) registry.

The TLS 1.3 cipher suite TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x1301) is required for TLS 1.3 and can't be disabled by this policy.

This policy does not affect QUIC-based connections. QUIC can be turned off via the [QuicAllowed](#quicallowed) policy.

  ### TabFreezingEnabled

  #### Allow freezing of background tabs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether Microsoft Edge can freeze tabs that are in the background for at least 5 minutes.

Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery, and memory usage. Microsoft Edge uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background, such as display notifications, play sound, and stream video.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes might be frozen.

If you disable this policy, no tabs will be frozen.

  ### URLAllowlist

  #### Define a list of allowed URLs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Setting the policy provides access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to [URLBlocklist](#urlblocklist).

Format the URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

You can use this policy to open exceptions to restrictive block lists. For example, you can include '\*' in the block list to block all requests, and then use this policy to allow access to a limited list of URLs. You can use this policy to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter determines if a URL is blocked or allowed. The allowed list takes precedence over the block list.

This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries are ignored.

This policy also allows the browser to automatically invoke external applications registered as protocol handlers for protocols like "tel:" or "ssh:".

If you don't configure this policy, there are no exceptions to the block list in the [URLBlocklist](#urlblocklist) policy.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  #### Block access to a list of URLs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that are blocked (your users can't load them).

Format the URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

You can define exceptions in the [URLAllowlist](#urlallowlist) policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries are ignored.

Note that blocking internal 'edge://*' URLs isn't recommended - this may lead to unexpected errors.

This policy doesn't prevent the page from updating dynamically through JavaScript. For example, if you block 'contoso.com/abc', users might still be able to visit 'contoso.com' and click on a link to visit 'contoso.com/abc', as long as the page doesn't refresh.

If you don't configure this policy, no URLs are blocked.

  ### UserAgentClientHintsEnabled

  #### Enable the User-Agent Client Hints feature (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 86 or later

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because it's only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content if and when it's found to be incompatible with the User-Agent Client Hints feature. It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 89.

When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers that provide information about the user browser (for example, the browser version) and environment (for example, the system architecture).

This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If you disable this policy, this feature is unavailable.

  ### UserDataDir

  #### Set the user data directory

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Set the directory to use for storing user data.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the specified directory regardless of whether the user has set the '--user-data-dir' command-line flag.

If you don't enable this policy, the default profile path is used, but the user can override it by using the '--user-data-dir' flag. Users can find the directory for the profile at edge://version/ under profile path.

To avoid data loss or other errors, don't configure this policy to a volume's root directory or to a directory that's used for other purposes, because Microsoft Edge manages its contents.

See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041) for a list of variables that can be used.

  ### UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit

  #### Limits the number of user data snapshots retained for use in case of emergency rollback

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 86 or later

  #### Description

  Following each major version update, Microsoft Edge will create a snapshot of parts of the user's browsing data to use in case of a later emergency that requires a temporary version rollback. If a temporary rollback is performed to a version for which a user has a corresponding snapshot, the data in the snapshot is restored. This lets users keep settings such as bookmarks and autofill data.

If you don't set this policy, the default value of 3 snapshots is used.

If you set this policy, old snapshots are deleted as needed to respect the limit you set. If you set this policy to 0, no snapshots are taken.

  ### VerticalTabsAllowed

  #### Configures availability of a vertical layout for tabs on the side of the browser

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  Configures whether a user can access an alternative layout where tabs are vertically aligned on the side of the browser instead of at the top.
When there are several tabs open, this layout provides better tab viewing and management. There's better visibility of the site titles,

  ### WinHttpProxyResolverEnabled

  #### Use Windows proxy resolver (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because it will be superseded by a similar feature in a future release, see https://crbug.com/1032820.

Use Windows to resolve proxies for all browser networking instead of the proxy resolver built into Microsoft Edge. The Windows proxy resolver enables Windows proxy features such as DirectAccess/NRPT.

This policy comes with the problems described by https://crbug.com/644030. It causes PAC files to be fetched and executed by Windows code, including PAC files set via the [ProxyPacUrl](#proxypacurl) policy. Since Network Fetches for the PAC file happen via Windows instead of Microsoft Edge code, network policies such as [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) will not apply to network fetches for a PAC file.

If you enable this policy, the Windows proxy resolver will be used.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the Microsoft Edge proxy resolver will be used.

  #### Supported features:
