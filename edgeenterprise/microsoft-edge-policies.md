# Microsoft Edge - Policies

The latest version of Microsoft Edge includes the following policies. You can use these policies to configure how Microsoft Edge runs in your organization.

For information about an additional set of policies used to control how and when Microsoft Edge is updated, check out [Microsoft Edge update policy reference](microsoft-edge-update-policies.md).

You can download the [Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55319) for the recommended security configuration baseline settings for Microsoft Edge. For more information see the [Microsoft Security Baselines Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines).

Starting in Microsoft Edge version 116, certain policies will not be applied to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account. For more information, please check an individual policy for details on whether it applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account.

  ## Application Guard settings policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### ApplicationGuardContainerProxy

  #### Application Guard Container Proxy

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the proxy settings for Microsoft Edge Application Guard.
If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard ignores other sources of proxy configurations.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge Application Guard uses the proxy configuration of the host.

This policy does not affect the proxy configuration of Microsoft Edge outside of Application Guard (on the host).

The ProxyMode field lets you specify the proxy server used by Microsoft Edge Application Guard.

The ProxyPacUrl field is a URL to a proxy .pac file.

The ProxyServer field is a URL for the proxy server.

If you choose the 'direct' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'auto_detect' value as 'ProxyMode', all other fields are ignored.

If you choose the 'fixed_servers' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyServer' field is used.

If you choose the 'pac_script' value as 'ProxyMode', the 'ProxyPacUrl' field is used.

For more information about identifying Application Guard traffic via dual proxy, visit [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134653](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2134653).

  Set whether Edge should ignore the Application Guard site list configuration for trusted and untrusted sites.

If you enable this policy, all navigations from Edge, including navigations to untrusted sites, will be accessed normally within Edge without redirecting to the Application Guard container. Note: this policy ONLY impacts Edge, so navigations from other browsers might get redirected to the Application Guard Container if you have the corresponding extensions enabled.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Edge does not ignore the Application Guard site list. If users try to navigate to an untrusted site in the host, the site will open in the container.

  ### AutoSelectCertificateForUrls

  #### Automatically select client certificates for these sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Setting the policy lets you make a list of URL patterns that specify sites for which Microsoft Edge can automatically select a client certificate. The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { "pattern": "$URL_PATTERN", "filter" : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

* When $FILTER is set to { "ISSUER": { "CN": "$ISSUER_CN" } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

* When $FILTER contains both the "ISSUER" and the "SUBJECT" sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with the "O" value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with a "OU" value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

* When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

If you leave the policy unset, there's no autoselection for any site.

  - On Windows and macOS since 86 or later

  #### Description

  If you set this policy, you can list the URL patterns that specify which sites can't ask users to grant them write access to files or directories in the host operating system's file system.

  ### IntranetFileLinksEnabled

  #### Allow intranet zone file URL links from Microsoft Edge to open in Windows File Explorer

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 95 or later

  #### Description

  This setting allows file URL links to intranet zone files from intranet zone HTTPS websites to open Windows File Explorer for that file or directory.

If you enable this policy, intranet zone file URL links originating from intranet zone HTTPS pages will open Windows File Explorer to the parent directory of the file and select the file. Intranet zone directory URL links originating from intranet zone HTTPS pages will open Windows File Explorer to the directory with no items in the directory selected.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, file URL links will not open.

Microsoft Edge uses the definition of intranet zone as configured for Internet Explorer. Note that https://localhost/ is specifically blocked as an exception of allowed intranet zone host, while loopback addresses (127.0.0.*, [::1]) are considered internet zone by default.

Users may opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the [ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox](#externalprotocoldialogshowalwaysopencheckbox) policy is disabled.

  ### JavaScriptJitAllowedForSites

  #### Allow JavaScript to use JIT on these sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of site url patterns that specify sites which are allowed to run JavaScript with JIT (Just In Time) compiler enabled.

For detailed information on valid site url patterns, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

JavaScript JIT policy exceptions will only be enforced at a site granularity (eTLD+1). A policy set for only subdomain.contoso.com will not correctly apply to contoso.com or subdomain.contoso.com since they both resolve to the same eTLD+1 (contoso.com) for which there is no policy. In this case, policy must be set on contoso.com to apply correctly for both contoso.com and subdomain.contoso.com.

This policy applies on a frame-by-frame basis and not based on top level origin url alone, so e.g. if contoso.com is listed in the JavaScriptJitAllowedForSites policy but contoso.com loads a frame containing fabrikam.com then contoso.com will have JavaScript JIT enabled, but fabrikam.com will use the policy from [DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting](#defaultjavascriptjitsetting), if set, or default to JavaScript JIT enabled.

If you don't configure this policy for a site then the policy from [DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting](#defaultjavascriptjitsetting) applies to the site, if set, otherwise Javascript JIT is enabled for the site.

  ### JavaScriptJitBlockedForSites

  #### Block JavaScript from using JIT on these sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of site url patterns that specify sites which are not allowed to run JavaScript JIT (Just In Time) compiler enabled.

Disabling the JavaScript JIT will mean that Microsoft Edge may render web content more slowly, and may also disable parts of JavaScript including WebAssembly. Disabling the JavaScript JIT may allow Microsoft Edge to render web content in a more secure configuration.

For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

  ### LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled

  #### Enable default legacy SameSite cookie behavior setting (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 94.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80, until 94

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to serve only as a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their environments if they were found to be incompatible with the SameSite behavior change.

If you still require legacy cookie behavior, please use [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList](#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabledfordomainlist) to configure behavior on a per-domain basis.

Lets you revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on other configuration sources for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature. These features can also be configured by a field trial or the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag in edge://flags.

Policy options mapping:

* DefaultToLegacySameSiteCookieBehavior (1) = Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on all sites

* DefaultToSameSiteByDefaultCookieBehavior (2) = Use SameSite-by-default behavior for cookies on all sites

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList

  #### Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on specified sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

  #### Description

  Cookies set for domains match specified patterns will revert to legacy SameSite behavior.

Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site.

If you don't set this policy, the global default value will be used. The global default will also be used for cookies on domains not covered by the patterns you specify.

The global default value can be configured using the [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) policy. If [LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled](#legacysamesitecookiebehaviorenabled) is unset, the global default value falls back to other configuration sources.

For detailed information about valid URL patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

Note that patterns you list in this policy are treated as domains, not URLs, so you should not specify a scheme or port.

  ### WebHidAllowDevicesWithHidUsagesForUrls

  #### Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to HID devices containing top-level collections with the given HID usage

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 109 or later

  #### Description

  This setting allows you to list the URLs that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a HID device containing a top-level collection with the given HID usage.

Each item in the list requires both usages and urls fields for the policy to be valid.

  * Each item in the usages field must have a usage_page and may have a usage field.

  * Omitting the usage field will create a policy matching any device containing a top-level collection with a usage from the specified usage page.

  * An item which has a usage field without a usage_page field is invalid and is ignored.

If you don't set this policy, that means [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](#defaultwebhidguardsetting) applies, if it's set. If not, the user's personal setting applies.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

URLs in this policy shouldn't conflict with those configured through [WebHidBlockedForUrls](#webhidblockedforurls). If they do, this policy takes precedence over [WebHidBlockedForUrls](#webhidblockedforurls).

  ### WebHidAskForUrls

  #### Allow the WebHID API on these sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 100 or later

  #### Description

  Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites can ask users to grant them access to a HID device.

Leaving the policy unset means [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](#defaultwebhidguardsetting) applies for all sites, if it's set. If not, users' personal settings apply.

For URL patterns that don't match the policy, the following values are applied in order of precedence:

  * [WebHidBlockedForUrls](#webhidblockedforurls) (if there is a match),

  * [DefaultWebHidGuardSetting](#defaultwebhidguardsetting) (if set), or

  * Users' personal settings.

URL patterns must not conflict with [WebHidBlockedForUrls](#webhidblockedforurls). Neither policy takes precedence if a URL matches both patterns.

For detailed information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

  ### WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls

  #### Grant access to specific sites to connect to specific USB devices

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of urls that specify which sites will automatically be granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list must contain both devices and urls in order for the policy to be valid. Each item in devices can contain a vendor ID and product ID field. Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.

The USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site ("requesting URL") and the URL of the top-level frame site ("embedding URL") to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the "urls" field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in "urls" must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.

If this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the [DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting](#defaultwebusbguardsetting) policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.

URL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via [WebUsbBlockedForUrls](#webusbblockedforurls). If there is a clash, this policy will take precedence over [WebUsbBlockedForUrls](#webusbblockedforurls) and [WebUsbAskForUrls](#webusbaskforurls).

  ### ExtensionInstallForcelist

  #### Control which extensions are installed silently

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Set this policy to specify a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction. Users can't uninstall or turn off this setting. Permissions are granted implicitly, including the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. Note: These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.

If you don't set this policy, no apps or extensions are autoinstalled and users can uninstall any app in Microsoft Edge.

This policy supercedes [ExtensionInstallBlocklist](#extensioninstallblocklist) policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Microsoft Edge automatically uninstalls it.

For Windows instances not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.

On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

The source code of any extension can be altered by users with developer tools, potentially rendering the extension unfunctional. If this is a concern, configure the [DeveloperToolsAvailability](#developertoolsavailability) policy.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on edge://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the "update" URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043) ). By default, the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website's update URL is used. The "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

Note: This policy doesn't apply to InPrivate mode. Read about hosting extensions at [Publish and update extensions in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website](/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/enterprise/hosting-and-updating).

  #### Supported features:

  ### ExtensionInstallSources

  #### Configure extension and user script install sources

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Define URLs that can install extensions and themes.

Define URLs that can install extensions and themes directly without having to drag and drop the packages to the edge://extensions page.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095039)). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (in other words, the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns. Do not host the files at a location that requires authentication.

The [ExtensionInstallBlocklist](#extensioninstallblocklist) policy takes precedence over this policy. Any extensions that's on the block list won't be installed, even if it comes from a site on this list.

  ### ExtensionSettings

  #### Configure extension management settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Setting this policy controls extension management settings for Microsoft Edge, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. This policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID "*", which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest. If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the update URL specified in the [ExtensionInstallForcelist](#extensioninstallforcelist) policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is the Edge Add-ons website update URL. For more details, check out the detailed guide to ExtensionSettings policy available at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2161555](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2161555).

To block extensions from a particular third party store, you only need to block the update_url for that store. For example, if you want to block extensions from Chrome Web Store, you can use the following JSON.

{"update_url:https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx":{"installation_mode":"blocked"}}

Note that you can still use [ExtensionInstallForcelist](#extensioninstallforcelist) and [ExtensionInstallAllowlist](#extensioninstallallowlist) to allow / force install specific extensions even if the store is blocked using the JSON in the previous example.

Note: For Windows instances not joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain and macOS instances not managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website.

Additional guidance:

This policy can be set as both Recommended as well as Mandatory, however with an important callout.

Mandatory enabled: Given that individual user consent is a pre-condition to enabling this feature for a given user, this policy does not have a Mandatory enabled setting. If the policy is set to Mandatory enabled, the UI in Settings will not change and the following error message will be displayed in edge://policy

Example Error state message: "This policy value is ignored because Password Monitor requires the consent of the individual user for it to be turned on. You can ask users in your Organization to go to Settings > Profile > Password and turn on the feature."

Recommended enabled: If the policy is set to Recommended enabled, the UI in Settings will remain in 'Off' state, but a briefcase icon will be made visible next to it with this description displayed on hover - "Your organization recommends a specific value for this setting and you have chosen a different value"

Mandatory and Recommended disabled: Both these states will work the normal way, with the usual captions being shown to users.

  ### PrimaryPasswordSetting

  #### Configures a setting that asks users to enter their device password while using password autofill

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

  #### Description

  The feature helps users add an additional layer of privacy to their online accounts by requiring device authentication (as a way of confirming the user's identity) before the saved password is auto-filled into a web form. This ensures that non-authorized persons can't use saved passwords for autofill.

This group policy configures the radio button selector that enables this feature for users. It also has a frequency control where users can specify how often they would like to be prompted for authentication.

If you set this policy to 'Automatically', disable this policy, or don't configure this policy, autofill will not have any authentication flow.

If you set this policy to 'WithDevicePassword', users will have to enter their device password (or preferred mode of authentication under Windows) to prove their identity before their password is auto filled. Authentication modes include Windows Hello, PIN, face recognition, or fingerprint. The frequency for authentication prompt will be set to 'Always' by default. However, users can change it to the other option, which is 'Once every browsing session'.

If you set this policy to 'WithCustomPrimaryPassword', users will be asked to create their custom password and then to be redirected to Settings. After the custom password is set, users can authenticate themselves using the custom password and their passwords will get auto-filled after successful authentication. The frequency for authentication prompt will be set to 'Always' by default. However, users can change it to the other option, which is 'Once every browsing session'.

If you set this policy to 'AutofillOff', saved passwords will no longer be suggested for autofill.

Policy options mapping:

* Automatically (0) = Automatically

* WithDevicePassword (1) = With device password

* WithCustomPrimaryPassword (2) = With custom primary password

* AutofillOff (3) = Autofill off

  ## Printing policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### DefaultPrinterSelection

  #### Default printer selection rules

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Overrides Microsoft Edge default printer selection rules. This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Microsoft Edge, which happens the first time a user tries to print a page.

When this policy is set, Microsoft Edge tries to find a printer that matches all of the specified attributes and uses it as default printer. If there are multiple printers that meet the criteria, the first printer that matches is used.

If you don't configure this policy or no matching printers are found within the timeout, the printer defaults to the built-in PDF printer or no printer, if the PDF printer isn't available.

The value is parsed as a JSON object, conforming to the following schema: { "type": "object", "properties": { "idPattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer id.", "type": "string" }, "namePattern": { "description": "Regular expression to match printer display name.", "type": "string" } } }

Omitting a field means all values match; for example, if you don't specify connectivity Print Preview starts discovering all kinds of local printers. Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensitive.

  ### PrintPostScriptMode

  #### Print PostScript Mode

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 96 or later

  #### Description

  Controls how Microsoft Edge prints on Microsoft Windows.

Printing to a PostScript printer on Microsoft Windows different PostScript generation methods can affect printing performance.

If you set this policy to Default, Microsoft Edge will use a set of default options when generating PostScript. For text in particular, text will always be rendered using Type 3 fonts.

If you set this policy to Type42, Microsoft Edge will render text using Type 42 fonts if possible. This should increase printing speed for some PostScript printers.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will be in Default mode.

  #### Print Rasterization Mode

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 90 or later

  #### Description

  Controls how Microsoft Edge prints on Windows.

When printing to a non-PostScript printer on Windows, sometimes print jobs need to be rasterized to print correctly.

If you set this policy to 'Full' or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge will do full page rasterization if necessary.

If you set this policy to 'Fast', Microsoft Edge will reduce the amount of rasterization which can help reduce print job sizes and increase printing speed.

Policy options mapping:

* Full (0) = Full page rasterization

* Fast (1) = Avoid rasterization if possible

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### PrintRasterizePdfDpi

  #### Print Rasterize PDF DPI

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 96 or later

  #### Description

  Controls print image resolution when Microsoft Edge prints PDFs with rasterization.

When printing a PDF using the Print to image option, it can be beneficial to specify a print resolution other than a device's printer setting or the PDF default.  A high resolution will significantly increase the processing and printing time while a low resolution can lead to poor imaging quality.

If you set this policy, it allows a particular resolution to be specified for use when rasterizing PDFs for printing.

If you set this policy to zero or don't configure it, the system default resolution will be used during rasterization of page images.

  ## Private Network Request Settings policies

  [Back to top](#microsoft-edge---policies)

  ### InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed

  #### Specifies whether to allow websites to make requests to more-private network endpoints

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 92 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether websites are allowed to make requests to more-private network endpoints.

When this policy is enabled, all Private Network Access checks are disabled for all origins. This may allow attackers to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks on private network servers.

When this policy is disabled or not configured, the default behavior for requests to more-private network endpoints will depend on the user's personal configuration for the BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests, PrivateNetworkAccessSendPreflights, and PrivateNetworkAccessRespectPreflightResults feature flags. These flags may be controlled by experimentation or set via the command line.

This policy relates to the Private Network Access specification. See https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/ for more details.

A network endpoint is more private than another if:
1) Its IP address is localhost and the other is not.
2) Its IP address is private and the other is public.
In the future, depending on spec evolution, this policy might apply to all cross-origin requests directed at private IPs or localhost.

When this policy enabled, websites are allowed to make requests to any network endpoint, subject to other cross-origin checks.

  #### Supported features:

  ### InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls

  #### Allow the listed sites to make requests to more-private network endpoints from in an insecure manner

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 92 or later

  #### Description

  List of URL patterns. Requests initiated from websites served by matching origins are not subject to Private Network Access checks.

  #### Description

  Configures the default home page URL in Microsoft Edge.

The home page is the page opened by the Home button. The pages that open on startup are controlled by the [RestoreOnStartup](#restoreonstartup) policies.

  ### NewTabPageCompanyLogo

  #### Set new tab page company logo (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 85.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79, until 85

  #### Description

  This policy didn't work as expected due to changes in operational requirements. Therefore it's obsolete and should not be used.

Specifies the company logo to use on the new tab page in Microsoft Edge.

The policy should be configured as a string that expresses the logo(s) in JSON format. For example: { "default_logo": { "url": "https://www.contoso.com/logo.png", "hash": "cd0aa9856147b6c5b4ff2b7dfee5da20aa38253099ef1b4a64aced233c9afe29" }, "light_logo": { "url": "https://www.contoso.com/light_logo.png", "hash": "517d286edb416bb2625ccfcba9de78296e90da8e32330d4c9c8275c4c1c33737" } }

You configure this policy by specifying the URL from which Microsoft Edge can download the logo and its cryptographic hash (SHA-256), which is used to verify the integrity of the download. The logo must be in PNG or SVG format, and its file size must not exceed 16 MB. The logo is downloaded and cached, and it will be redownloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes. The URL must be accessible without any authentication.

The 'default_logo' is required and will be used when there's no background image. If 'light_logo' is provided, it will be used when the user's new tab page has a background image. We recommend a horizontal logo with a transparent background that is left-aligned and vertically centered. The logo should have a minimum height of 32 pixels and an aspect ratio from 1:1 to 4:1. The 'default_logo' should have proper contrast against a white/black background while the 'light_logo' should have proper contrast against a background image.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge downloads and shows the specified logo(s) on the new tab page. Users can't override or hide the logo(s).

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will show no company logo or a Microsoft logo on the new tab page.

For help with determining the SHA-256 hash, see [Get-FileHash](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash).

  ### NewTabPageLocation

  #### Configure the new tab page URL

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the default URL for the new tab page.

The recommended version of this policy does not currently work and functions exactly like the mandatory version.

This policy determines the page that's opened when new tabs are created (including when new windows are opened). It also affects the startup page if that's set to open to the new tab page.

This policy doesn't determine which page opens on startup; that's controlled by the [RestoreOnStartup](#restoreonstartup) policy. It also doesn't affect the home page if that's set to open to the new tab page.

If you don't configure this policy, the default new tab page is used.

If you configure this policy *and* the [NewTabPageSetFeedType](#newtabpagesetfeedtype) policy, this policy has precedence.

If a blank tab is preferred, "about:blank" is the correct URL to use, not "about://blank".

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  ### NewTabPageManagedQuickLinks

  #### Set new tab page quick links

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

  #### Description

  By default, Microsoft Edge displays quick links on the new tab page from user-added shortcuts and top sites based on browsing history. With this policy, you can configure up to three quick link tiles on the new tab page, expressed as a JSON object:

[ { "url": "https://www.contoso.com", "title": "Contoso Portal", "pinned": true/false }, ... ]

The 'url' field is required; 'title' and 'pinned' are optional. If 'title' is not provided, the URL is used as the default title. If 'pinned' is not provided, the default value is false.

Microsoft Edge presents these in the order listed, from left to right, with all pinned tiles displayed ahead of non-pinned tiles.

If the policy is set as mandatory, the 'pinned' field will be ignored and all tiles will be pinned. The tiles can't be deleted by the user and will always appear at the front of the quick links list.

If the policy is set as recommended, pinned tiles will remain in the list but the user has the ability to edit and delete them. Quick link tiles that aren't pinned behave like default top sites and are pushed off the list if other websites are visited more frequently. When applying non-pinned links via this policy to an existing browser profile, the links may not appear at all, depending on how they rank compared to the user's browsing history.

  #### Supported features:

  ### AllowDeletingBrowserHistory

  #### Enable deleting browser and download history

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Enables deleting browser history and download history and prevents users from changing this setting.

Note that even with this policy is disabled, the browsing and download history aren't guaranteed to be retained: users can edit or delete the history database files directly, and the browser itself may remove (based on expiration period) or archive any or all history items at any time.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, users can delete the browsing and download history.

If you disable this policy, users can't delete browsing and download history. Disabling this policy will disable history sync and open tab sync.

If you enable this policy, don't enable the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy, because they both deal with deleting data. If you enable both, the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy takes precedence and deletes all data when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how this policy is configured.

  ### AudioSandboxEnabled

  #### Allow the audio sandbox to run

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls the audio process sandbox.

If you enable this policy, the audio process will run sandboxed.

If you disable this policy, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.

If you don't configure this policy, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which might differ based on the platform.

This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### AutoImportAtFirstRun

  #### Automatically import another browser's data and settings at first run

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable this policy, all supported datatypes and settings from the specified browser will be silently and automatically imported at first run. During the First Run Experience, the import section will also be skipped.

The browser data from Microsoft Edge Legacy will always be silently migrated at the first run, irrespective of the value of this policy.

If this policy is set to 'FromDefaultBrowser', then the datatypes corresponding to the default browser on the managed device will be imported.

If the browser specified as the value of this policy is not present in the managed device, Microsoft Edge will simply skip the import without any notification to the user.

If you set this policy to 'DisabledAutoImport', the import section of the first-run experience is skipped entirely and Microsoft Edge doesn't import browser data and settings automatically.

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromInternetExplorer', the following datatypes will be imported from Internet Explorer:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Search engines
4. Browsing history
5. Home page

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromGoogleChrome', the following datatypes will be imported from Google Chrome:
1. Favorites
2. Saved passwords
3. Addresses and more
4. Payment info
5. Browsing history
6. Settings
7. Pinned and Open tabs
8. Extensions
9. Cookies

Note: For more details on what is imported from Google Chrome, please see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120835](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2120835)

If this policy is set to the value of 'FromSafari', user data is no longer imported into Microsoft Edge. This is due to the way Full Disk Access works on Mac.
On macOS Mojave and above, it's no longer possible to have automated and unattended import of Safari data into Microsoft Edge.

Starting with Microsoft Edge version 83, if this policy is set to the value of 'FromMozillaFirefox', the following datatypes will be imported from Mozilla Firefox:
1. Favorites or bookmarks
2. Saved passwords
3. Addresses and more
4. Browsing History

If you want to restrict specific datatypes from getting imported on the managed devices, you can use this policy with other policies such as [ImportAutofillFormData](#importautofillformdata), [ImportBrowserSettings](#importbrowsersettings), [ImportFavorites](#importfavorites), and etc.

Policy options mapping:

* FromDefaultBrowser (0) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from the default browser

* FromInternetExplorer (1) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Internet Explorer

* FromGoogleChrome (2) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Google Chrome

* FromSafari (3) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Safari

* DisabledAutoImport (4) = Disables automatic import, and the import section of the first-run experience is skipped

* FromMozillaFirefox (5) = Automatically imports all supported datatypes and settings from Mozilla Firefox

  ### AutoLaunchProtocolsComponentEnabled

  #### AutoLaunch Protocols Component Enabled

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 96 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies whether the AutoLaunch Protocols component should be enabled. This component allows Microsoft to provide a list similar to that of the [AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins](#autolaunchprotocolsfromorigins) policy, allowing certain external protocols to launch without prompt or blocking certain protocols (on specified origins). By default, this component is enabled.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the AutoLaunch Protocols component is enabled.

If you disable this policy, the AutoLaunch Protocols component is disabled.

  #### Supported features:

  ### AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins

  #### Define a list of protocols that can launch an external application from listed origins without prompting the user

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns, that can launch an external application without prompting the user. The trailing separator should not be included when listing the protocol. For example, list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to launch an external application without prompting by policy if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch prompt will not be omitted by policy.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can launch without a prompt. Users can opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the [ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox](#externalprotocoldialogshowalwaysopencheckbox) policy is set to Disabled. This policy has no impact on per-protocol/per-site prompt exemptions set by users.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the [URLBlocklist](#urlblocklist) policy, which are documented at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

This policy does not work as expected with file://* wildcards.

  ### AutoOpenFileTypes

  #### List of file types that should be automatically opened on download

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  This policy sets a list of file types that should be automatically opened on download. Note: The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list "txt" instead of ".txt".

By default, these file types will be automatically opened on all URLs. You can use the [AutoOpenAllowedForURLs](#autoopenallowedforurls) policy to restrict the URLs for which these file types will be automatically opened on.

Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

File types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will continue to do so when downloaded. The user will continue to be able to specify other file types to be automatically opened.

If you don't set this policy, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  ### AutomaticHttpsDefault

  #### Configure Automatic HTTPS

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 92 or later

  #### Description

  This policy lets you manage settings for [AutomaticHttpsDefault](#automatichttpsdefault), which switches connections from HTTP to HTTPS.

This feature helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks by enforcing more secure connections, but users might experience more connection errors.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 111, "UpgradePossibleDomains" is deprecated and is treated the same as "DisableAutomaticHttps". It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 114.

Policy options mapping:

* DisableAutomaticHttps (0) = Automatic HTTPS functionality is disabled.

* UpgradeCapableDomains (1) = (Deprecated) Navigations delivered over HTTP are switched to HTTPS, only on domains likely to support HTTPS.

* AlwaysUpgrade (2) = All navigations delivered over HTTP are switched to HTTPS. Connection errors might occur more often.

  #### Allow media autoplay for websites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  This policy sets the media autoplay policy for websites.

The default setting, "Not configured" respects the current media autoplay settings and lets users configure their autoplay settings.

Setting to "Enabled" sets media autoplay to "Allow".  All websites are allowed to autoplay media. Users can't override this policy.

Setting to "Disabled" sets media autoplay to "Limit".  This limits websites that are allowed to autoplay media to webpages with high media engagement and active WebRTC streams. Prior to Microsoft Edge version 92, this would set media autoplay to "Block". Users can't override this policy.

A tab will need to be closed and re-opened for this policy to take effect.

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 95 or later

  #### Description

  Sets the ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy on Microsoft Edge's browser process to block code injection from legacy third party applications.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy is applied to block legacy extension points in the browser process.

If you disable this policy, the ProcessExtensionPointDisablePolicy is not applied to block legacy extension points in the browser process. This has a detrimental effect on Microsoft Edge's security and stability as unknown and potentially hostile code can load inside Microsoft Edge's browser process. Only turn off the policy if there are compatibility issues with third-party software that must run inside Microsoft Edge's browser process.

  ### BrowserSignin

  #### Browser sign-in settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specify whether a user can sign into Microsoft Edge with their account and use account-related services like sync and single sign on. To control the availability of sync, use the [SyncDisabled](#syncdisabled) policy instead.

If you set this policy to 'Disable', make sure that you also set the [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) policy to disabled because [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) disables the creation of an automatically signed in browser profile. If both policies are set, Microsoft Edge will use the 'Disable browser sign-in' policy and behave as if [NonRemovableProfileEnabled](#nonremovableprofileenabled) is set to disabled.

If you set this policy to 'Enable', users can sign into the browser. Signing into the browser doesn't mean that sync is turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature.

If you set this policy to 'Force', users must sign into a profile to use the browser. By default, this will allow the user to choose whether they want to sync to their account, unless sync is disabled by the domain admin or with the [SyncDisabled](#syncdisabled) policy. The default value of [BrowserGuestModeEnabled](#browserguestmodeenabled) policy is set to false.

If you don't configure this policy users can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit.

Policy options mapping:

* Disable (0) = Disable browser sign-in

* Enable (1) = Enable browser sign-in

* Force (2) = Force users to sign-in to use the browser

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### BuiltInDnsClientEnabled

  #### Use built-in DNS client

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether to use the built-in DNS client.

This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the operating system DNS client, or Microsoft Edge's built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Microsoft Edge always uses the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

If you enable this policy, the built-in DNS client is used, if it's available.

If you disable this policy, the built-in DNS client is only used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.

If you don't configure this policy, the built-in DNS client is enabled by default on Windows, macOS and Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled).

  #### Supported features:

  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 106.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On macOS since 83, until 106

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete because it was a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their environments and report issues if they are found to be incompatible with the built-in certificate verifier.

  - On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

  #### Description

  If this policy is not configured, or is set to enabled, then Microsoft Edge will follow the default rollout process for CECPQ2, a post-quantum key-agreement algorithm in TLS.

CECPQ2 results in larger TLS messages which, in very rare cases, can trigger bugs in some networking hardware. This policy can be set to False to disable CECPQ2 while networking issues are resolved.

This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of Microsoft Edge.

  ### CORSNonWildcardRequestHeadersSupport

  #### CORS non-wildcard request header support enabled

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 97 or later

  #### Description

  This policy lets you configure support of CORS non-wildcard request headers.

Microsoft Edge version 97 introduces support for CORS non-wildcard request headers. When a script makes a cross-origin network request via fetch() and XMLHttpRequest with a script-added Authorization header, the header must be explicitly allowed by the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response. "Explicitly" here means that the wild card symbol "*" doesn't cover the Authorization header. See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2180022](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2180022) for more detail.

If you enable or don't configure the policy, Microsoft Edge will support the CORS non-wildcard request headers and behave as previously described.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will allow the wildcard symbol ("*") in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response to cover the Authorization header.

This policy is a temporary workaround for the new CORS non-wildcard request header feature. It's intended to be removed in the future.

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcement of Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed to still be used for Enterprise hosts.

To disable Certificate Transparency enforcement when this policy is set, one of the following sets of conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the "/" character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is "sha256".

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of legacy certificate authorities

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of legacy certificate authorities (Cas).

This policy lets you disable Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed, continue to be used for enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled, you must set the hash to a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a legacy certificate authority (CA). A legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default by one or more operating systems supported by Microsoft Edge.

You specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the "/" character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is "sha256".

If you don't configure this policy, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it isn't disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

  ### CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls

  #### Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for specific URLs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for the listed URLs.

This policy lets you not disclose certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs via Certificate Transparency. This lets you use certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they weren't properly publicly disclosed, but it makes it harder to detect mis-issued certificates for those hosts.

Form your URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). Because certificates are valid for a given hostname, independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname part of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If you don't configure this policy, any certificate that should be disclosed via Certificate Transparency is treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed.

This policy does not work as expected with file://* wildcards.

  ### ClearBrowsingDataOnExit

  #### Clear browsing data when Microsoft Edge closes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  Microsoft Edge doesn't clear the browsing data by default when it closes. Browsing data includes information entered in forms, passwords, and even the websites visited.

If you enable this policy, all browsing data is deleted each time Microsoft Edge closes. Note that if you enable this policy, it takes precedence over how you configured [DefaultCookiesSetting](#defaultcookiessetting)

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can configure the Clear browsing data option in Settings.

If you enable this policy, don't configure the [AllowDeletingBrowserHistory](#allowdeletingbrowserhistory) or the [ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit](#clearcachedimagesandfilesonexit) policy, because they all deal with deleting browsing data. If you configure the preceding policies and this policy, all browsing data is deleted when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how you configured [AllowDeletingBrowserHistory](#allowdeletingbrowserhistory) or [ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit](#clearcachedimagesandfilesonexit).

To exclude cookies from being deleted on exit, configure the [SaveCookiesOnExit](#savecookiesonexit) policy.
To exclude passwords from being deleted on exit, configure the [SavePasswordsOnExit](#savepasswordsonexit) policy.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit

  #### Clear cached images and files when Microsoft Edge closes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  Microsoft Edge doesn't clear cached images and files by default when it closes.

If you enable this policy, cached images and files will be deleted each time Microsoft Edge closes.

If you disable this policy, users cannot configure the cached images and files option in edge://settings/clearBrowsingDataOnClose.

If you don't configure this policy, users can choose whether cached images and files are cleared on exit.

If you disable this policy, don't enable the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy, because they both deal with deleting data. If you configure both, the [ClearBrowsingDataOnExit](#clearbrowsingdataonexit) policy takes precedence and deletes all data when Microsoft Edge closes, regardless of how you configured [ClearCachedImagesAndFilesOnExit](#clearcachedimagesandfilesonexit).

  ### ClickOnceEnabled

  #### Allow users to open files using the ClickOnce protocol

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78 or later

  #### Description

  Allow users to open files using the ClickOnce protocol. The ClickOnce protocol allows websites to request that the browser open files from a specific URL using the ClickOnce file handler on the user's computer or device.

If you enable this policy, users can open files using the ClickOnce protocol. This policy overrides the user's ClickOnce setting in the edge://flags/ page.

If you disable this policy, users can't open files using the ClickOnce protocol. Instead, the file will be saved to the file system using the browser. This policy overrides the user's ClickOnce setting in the edge://flags/ page.

If you don't configure this policy, users with Microsoft Edge versions before Microsoft Edge 87 can't open files using the ClickOnce protocol by default. However, they have the option to enable the use of the ClickOnce protocol with the edge://flags/ page. Users with Microsoft Edge versions 87 and later can open files using the ClickOnce protocol by default but have the option to disable the ClickOnce protocol with edge://flags/ page.

Disabling ClickOnce may prevent ClickOnce applications (.application files) from launching properly.

For more information about ClickOnce, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103872](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2103872) and [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099880](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2099880).

  ### ClipboardAllowedForUrls

  #### Allow clipboard use on specific sites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 109 or later

  #### Description

  Configure the list of URL patterns that specify which sites can use the clipboard site permission.

Setting the policy lets you create a list of URL patterns that specify which sites can use the clipboard site permission. This doesn't include all clipboard operations on origins that match the patterns. For example, users will still be able to paste using keyboard shortcuts because this isn't controlled by the clipboard site permission.

Leaving the policy unset means [DefaultClipboardSetting](#defaultclipboardsetting) applies for all sites if it's set. If it isn't set, the user's personal setting applies.

For more information about valid url patterns, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322). * is not an accepted value for this policy.

  ### CommandLineFlagSecurityWarningsEnabled

  #### Enable security warnings for command-line flags

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  If disabled, this policy prevents security warnings from appearing when Microsoft Edge is launched with potentially dangerous command-line flags.

If enabled or unset, security warnings are displayed when these command-line flags are used to launch Microsoft Edge.

For example, the --disable-gpu-sandbox flag generates this warning:  You're using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-gpu-sandbox. This poses stability and security risks.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  #### Supported features:

  ### ComponentUpdatesEnabled

  #### Enable component updates in Microsoft Edge

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable or don't configure this policy, component updates are enabled in Microsoft Edge.

If you disable this policy or set it to false, component updates are disabled for all components in Microsoft Edge.

However, some components are exempt from this policy. This includes any component that doesn't contain executable code, that doesn't significantly alter the behavior of the browser, or that's critical for security. That is, updates that are deemed "critical for security" are still applied even if you disable this policy.

Examples of such components include the certificate revocation lists and security lists like tracking prevention lists.

Please note that disabling this policy can potentially prevent the Microsoft Edge developers from providing critical security fixes in a timely manner and is thus not recommended.

  This policy lets you configure Compose in Microsoft Edge. Compose provides help for writing with AI-generated text, which lets the user get ideas for writing. This includes elaborating on text, re-writing, changing tone, formatting the text, and more.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, Compose can provide text generation for eligible fields, which are text editable and don't have an autocomplete attribute.

If you disable this policy, Compose will not be able to provide text generation for eligible fields. Compose will still be available for prompt-based text generation through the sidebar and must be managed with either [EdgeDiscoverEnabled](#edgediscoverenabled) policy or [HubsSidebarEnabled](#hubssidebarenabled) policy.

  ### ConfigureDoNotTrack

  #### Configure Do Not Track

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specify whether to send Do Not Track requests to websites that ask for tracking info. Do Not Track requests let the websites you visit know that you don't want your browsing activity to be tracked.

  ### ConfigureFriendlyURLFormat

  #### Configure the default paste format of URLs copied from Microsoft Edge, and determine if additional formats will be available to users

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 87 or later
  - On macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  If FriendlyURLs are enabled, Microsoft Edge will compute additional representations of the URL and place them on the clipboard.

This policy configures what format will be pasted when the user pastes in external applications, or inside Microsoft Edge without the 'Paste as' context menu item.

If configured, this policy makes a choice on behalf of the user. The options in edge://settings/shareCopyPaste will be grayed out, and the options in the 'Paste As' context menu will not be available.

* Not configured = The user will be able to choose their preferred paste format. By default, this is set to the friendly URL format. The 'Paste As' menu will be available in Microsoft Edge.

* 1 = No additional formats will be stored on the clipboard. There will be no 'Paste as' context menu item in Microsoft Edge and the only format available to paste will be the plain text URL format. Effectively, the friendly URL feature will be disabled.

* 3 = The user will get a friendly URL whenever they paste into surfaces that accept rich text. The plain URL will still be available for non-rich surfaces. There will be no 'Paste As' menu in Microsoft Edge.

* 4 = (Not currently used)

The richer formats may not be well-supported in some paste destinations and/or websites. In these scenarios, the plain URL option is recommended when configuring this policy.

The recommended policy is available in Microsoft Edge 105 or later.

Policy options mapping:

* PlainText (1) = The plain URL without any extra information, such as the page's title. This is the recommended option when this policy is configured. For more information, see the description.

* TitledHyperlink (3) = Titled Hyperlink: A hyperlink that points to the copied URL, but whose visible text is the title of the destination page. This is the Friendly URL format.

* WebPreview (4) = Coming soon. If set, behaves the same as 'Plain URL'.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### ConfigureOnPremisesAccountAutoSignIn

  #### Configure automatic sign in with an Active Directory domain account when there is no Azure AD domain account

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 81 or later

  #### Description

  Enable the use of Active Directory accounts for automatic sign in if your users' machines are Domain Joined and your environment is not hybrid joined. If you want users automatically signed in with their Azure Active Directory accounts instead, please Azure AD join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118197) for more information) or hybrid join (See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118365) for more information) your environment.

On every launch, Microsoft Edge will try to sign-in using this policy, as long as the first profile being launched isn't signed-in or an auto sign-in hasn't happened before.

If you have configured the [BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) policy to disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable', Microsoft Edge will automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines using their Active Directory accounts.

If you set this policy to 'Disabled' or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will not automatically sign in users that are on domain joined machines with Active Directory accounts.

From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with [RoamingProfileSupportEnabled](#roamingprofilesupportenabled) policy disabled and machine is now hybrid joined i.e it has an Azure AD account, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile to get full Azure AD sync facilities.

From Microsoft Edge 93 onwards, if policy [ImplicitSignInEnabled](#implicitsigninenabled) is disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

From Microsoft Edge 94 onwards, if policy [OnlyOnPremisesImplicitSigninEnabled](#onlyonpremisesimplicitsigninenabled) is enabled, and this policy is set to 'SignInAndMakeDomainAccountNonRemovable', it will take effect even on hybrid joined environment. Microsoft Edge will automatically sign in users using their Active Directory domain account even if there are MSA or AAD accounts.

  ### ConfigureViewInFileExplorer

  #### Configure the View in File Explorer feature for SharePoint pages in Microsoft Edge

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 93 or later

  #### Description

  This setting allows you to configure the View in File Explorer capability for file management in SharePoint Online while using Microsoft Edge.

You will need to list the specific domains where this is allowed and list cookies needed for SharePoint authentication (rtFa and FedAuth).

Behind the scenes, the policy allows URLs with the viewinfileexplorer: scheme to open WebDAV URLs in Windows File Explorer on pages matching the list of domains and uses the cookies you specified for WebDAV authentication.

If you enable this policy, you can use the "View in File Explorer" feature on the SharePoint document libraries you list. You will need to specify the SharePoint domain and authentication cookies. See example value below.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, you cannot use the "View in File Explorer" feature on SharePoint document libraries.

Note that while this is an available option through Microsoft Edge, rather than use the View in File Explorer option, the recommended approach to managing files and folders outside of SharePoint is to sync your SharePoint files or move or copy files in SharePoint.

  ### DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled

  #### DNS interception checks enabled

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures a local switch that can be used to disable DNS interception checks. These checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

This detection might not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known. It can be disabled to avoid additional DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

  ### DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled

  #### Set Microsoft Edge as default browser

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows 7 and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  If you set this policy to True, Microsoft Edge always checks whether it's the default browser on startup and, if possible, automatically registers itself.

If you set this policy to False, Microsoft Edge is stopped from ever checking if it's the default and turns user controls off for this option.

If you don't set this policy, Microsoft Edge lets users control whether it's the default and, if not, whether user notifications should appear.

Note for Windows administrators: This policy only works for PCs running Windows 7. For later versions of Windows, you have to deploy a "default application associations" file that makes Microsoft Edge the handler for the https and http protocols (and, optionally, the ftp protocol and file formats such as .html, .htm, .pdf, .svg, .webp). See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094932](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2094932) for more information.

  ### DefaultShareAdditionalOSRegionSetting

  #### Set the default "share additional operating system region" setting

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 108 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls the default value for the "share additional operating system region" setting in Microsoft Edge.

The "share additional operating system region" Microsoft Edge setting controls whether the OS Regional format setting will be shared with the web through the default JavaScript locale. If shared, websites will be able to query the OS Regional format using JavaScript code, for example; "Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().locale". The default value for the setting is "Limited".

If you set this policy to "Limited", the OS Regional format will only be shared if its language part matches the Microsoft Edge display language.

If you set this policy to "Always", the OS Regional format will always be shared. This value could cause unexpected website behavior if the OS Regional format language is different from the Microsoft Edge display language. For example, if a website uses the JavaScript default locale to format dates, the names of the days and months can be displayed in one language while the surrounding text is displayed in another language.

If you set this policy to "Never", the OS Regional format will never be shared.

Example 1: In this example the OS Regional format is set to "en-GB" and the browser display language is set to "en-US". Then the OS Regional format will be shared if the policy is set to "Limited", or "Always".

Example 2: In this example the OS Regional format is set to "es-MX" and the browser display language is set to "en-US". Then the OS Regional format will be shared if the policy is set to "Always" but will not if the policy is set to "Limited".

For more information about this setting, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222282](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222282)

Policy options mapping:

* Limited (0) = Limited

* Always (1) = Always share the OS Regional format

* Never (2) = Never share the OS Regional format

  ### DefinePreferredLanguages

  #### Define an ordered list of preferred languages that websites should display in if the site supports the language

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 89 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the language variants that Microsoft Edge sends to websites as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header and prevents users from adding, removing, or changing the order of preferred languages in Microsoft Edge settings. Users who want to change the languages Microsoft Edge displays in or offers to translate pages to will be limited to the languages configured in this policy.

If you enable this policy, websites will appear in the first language in the list that they support unless other site-specific logic is used to determine the display language. The language variants defined in this policy override the languages configured as part of the [SpellcheckLanguage](#spellchecklanguage) policy.

If you don't configure or disable this policy, Microsoft Edge sends websites the user-specified preferred languages as part of the Accept-Language request HTTP header.

For detailed information on valid language variants, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148854).

  ### DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload

  #### Require that the Enterprise Mode Site List is available before tab navigation

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Lets you specify whether Microsoft Edge tabs wait to navigate until the browser has downloaded the initial Enterprise Mode Site List. This setting is intended for the scenario where the browser home page should load in Internet Explorer mode, and it is important that is does so on browser first run after IE mode is enabled. If this scenario does not exist, we recommend not enabling this setting because it can negatively impact the performance of loading the home page. The setting only applies when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached Enterprise Mode Site List, such as on browser first run after IE mode is enabled.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and one of either the
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) or the [InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationcloudsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

The timeout behavior of this policy can be configured with the [NavigationDelayForInitialSiteListDownloadTimeout](#navigationdelayforinitialsitelistdownloadtimeout) policy.

If you set this policy to 'All', when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs delay navigating until the browser has downloaded the site list. Sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode by the site list will load in Internet Explorer mode, even during the initial navigation of the browser. Sites that cannot possibly be configured to open in Internet Explorer, such as any site with a scheme other than http:, https:, file:, or ftp: do not delay navigating and load immediately in Edge mode.

When used in conjunction with the [InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationcloudsitelist) policy, during first launch of Microsoft Edge, there is a delay because implicit sign-in needs to finish before Microsoft Edge attempts to download the site list from the Microsoft cloud, since this requires authentication to the cloud service.

If you set this policy to 'None' or don't configure it, when Microsoft Edge does not have a cached version of the Enterprise Mode Site List, tabs will navigate immediately, and not wait for the browser to download the Enterprise Mode Site List. Sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode by the site list will open in Microsoft Edge mode until the browser has finished downloading the Enterprise Mode Site List.

Policy options mapping:

* None (0) = None

* All (1) = All eligible navigations

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### DiskCacheSize

  #### Set disk cache size, in bytes

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures the size of the cache, in bytes, used to store files on the disk.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the provided cache size regardless of whether the user has specified the '--disk-cache-size' flag. The value specified in this policy isn't a hard boundary but rather a suggestion to the caching system; any value below a few megabytes is too small and will be rounded up to a reasonable minimum.

If you set the value of this policy to 0, the default cache size is used, and users can't change it.

If you don't configure this policy, the default size is used, but users can override it with the '--disk-cache-size' flag.

Note: The value specified in this policy is used as a hint to various cache subsystems in the browser. The aggregate disk usage of all caches may therefore be larger than (but within the same order of magnitude as) the value specified.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### DisplayCapturePermissionsPolicyEnabled

  #### Specifies whether the display-capture permissions-policy is checked or skipped (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 109.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 95, until 109

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete. The policy was a temporary workaround for non-spec-compliant enterprise applications.

This policy stopped working in Microsoft Edge 107 and was obsoleted in Microsoft Edge 110.

The display-capture permissions-policy gates access to getDisplayMedia(),
as per this spec:
https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#feature-policy-integration
However, if this policy is Disabled, this requirement is not enforced,
and getDisplayMedia() is allowed from contexts that would otherwise be
forbidden.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, sites can only call getDisplayMedia() from
contexts which are allowlisted by the display-capture permissions-policy.

If you disable this policy, sites can call getDisplayMedia() even from contexts
which are not allowlisted by the display-capture permissions policy.
Note that other restrictions may still apply.

  ### DnsOverHttpsMode

  #### Control the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  Control the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query. The mode can be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

The "off" mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

The "automatic" mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

The "secure" mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

If you don't configure this policy, the browser might send DNS-over-HTTPS requests to a resolver associated with the user's configured system resolver.

Policy options mapping:

* off (off) = Disable DNS-over-HTTPS

* automatic (automatic) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS with insecure fallback

* secure (secure) = Enable DNS-over-HTTPS without insecure fallback

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### DnsOverHttpsTemplates

  #### Specify URI template of desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 83 or later

  #### Description

  The URI template of the desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. To specify multiple DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers, separate the corresponding URI templates with spaces.

If you set [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) to "secure" then this policy must be set and cannot be empty.

If you set [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) to "automatic" and this policy is set then the URI templates specified will be used. If you don't set this policy, then hardcoded mappings will be used to attempt to upgrade the user's current DNS resolver to a DoH resolver operated by the same provider.

If the URI template contains a dns variable, requests to the resolver will use GET; otherwise requests will use POST.

Incorrectly formatted templates will be ignored.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### DoNotSilentlyBlockProtocolsFromOrigins

  #### Define a list of protocols that can not be silently blocked by anti-flood protection

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 99 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to create a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns. These origins won't be silently blocked from launching an external application by anti-flood protection. The trailing separator shouldn't be included when listing the protocol. For example, list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

If you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to bypass being silently blocked by anti-flood protection if:

- the protocol is listed

- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.

If either condition is false, the external protocol launch may be blocked by anti-flood protection.

If you don't configure this policy, no protocols can bypass being silently blocked.

The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the [URLBlocklist](#urlblocklist) policy, that are documented at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

This policy doesn't work as expected with file://* wildcards.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### EnableDeprecatedWebPlatformFeatures

  #### Re-enable deprecated web platform features for a limited time (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 86.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77, until 86

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete because dedicated web platform policies are now used to manage individual web platform feature deprecations.

Specify a list of deprecated web platform features to temporarily re-enable.

This policy lets you re-enable deprecated web platform features for a limited time. Features are identified by a string tag.

If you don't configure this policy, if the list is empty, or if a feature doesn't match one of the supported string tags, all deprecated web platform features remain disabled.

While the policy itself is supported on the above platforms, the feature it's enabling might not be available on all of those platforms. Not all deprecated Web Platform features can be re-enabled. Only those explicitly listed below can be re-enabled, and only for a limited period of time, which differs per feature. You can review the intent behind the Web Platform feature changes at https://bit.ly/blinkintents.

The general format of the string tag is [DeprecatedFeatureName]_EffectiveUntil[yyyymmdd].

Policy options mapping:

* ExampleDeprecatedFeature (ExampleDeprecatedFeature_EffectiveUntil20080902) = Enable ExampleDeprecatedFeature API through 2008/09/02

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### EnableDomainActionsDownload

  #### Enable Domain Actions Download from Microsoft (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 84.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77, until 84

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because conflicting states should be avoided. This policy was used to enable/disable download of the domain actions list, but it didn't always achieve the desired state. The Experimentation and Configuration Service, which handles the download, has its own policy to configure what is downloaded from the service. Use the [ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl](#experimentationandconfigurationservicecontrol) policy instead.

In Microsoft Edge, Domain Actions represent a series of compatibility features that help the browser work correctly on the web.

Microsoft keeps a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.

When the browser starts up and then periodically afterwards, the browser will contact the Experimentation and Configuration Service that contains the most up to date list of compatibility actions to perform. This list is saved locally after it is first retrieved so that subsequent requests will only update the list if the server's copy has changed.

If you enable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

If you disable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will no longer be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

If you don't configure this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.

  ### EnableOnlineRevocationChecks

  #### Enable online OCSP/CRL checks

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Online revocation checks don't provide a significant security benefit and are disabled by default.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will perform soft-fail, online OCSP/CRL checks. "Soft fail" means that if the revocation server can't be reached, the certificate will be considered valid.

If you disable the policy or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge won't perform online revocation checks.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No

  ### EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors

  #### Allow certificates signed using SHA-1 when issued by local trust anchors (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 91.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85, until 91

  #### Description

  When this setting is enabled, Microsoft Edge allows connections secured by SHA-1 signed certificates so long as the the certificate chains to a locally-installed root certificate and is otherwise valid.

Note that this policy depends on the operating system (OS) certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy might no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1. This policy will be removed in Microsoft Edge 92 releasing in mid 2021.

If you don't set this policy or set it to false, or the SHA-1 certificate chains to a publicly trusted certificate root, then Microsoft Edge won't allow certificates signed by SHA-1.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management, or macOS instances that are that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### EncryptedClientHelloEnabled

  #### TLS Encrypted ClientHello Enabled

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 108 or later

  #### Description

  Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) is an extension to TLS that encrypts the sensitive fields of ClientHello to improve privacy.

If ECH is enabled, Microsoft Edge might or might not use ECH depending on server support, the availability of the HTTPS DNS record, or the rollout status.

If you enable or do not configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will follow the default rollout process for ECH.

If this policy is disabled, Microsoft Edge will not enable ECH.

Because ECH is an evolving protocol, Microsoft Edge's implementation is subject to change.

As such, this policy is a temporary measure to control the initial experimental implementation. It will be replaced with final controls as the protocol finalizes.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
  - Per Profile: No
  - Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

  ### EnforceLocalAnchorConstraintsEnabled

  #### Determines whether the built-in certificate verifier will enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 113 or later

  #### Description

  X.509 certificates may encode constraints, such as Name Constraints, in extensions in the certificate. RFC 5280 specifies that enforcing such constraints on trust anchor certificates is optional.

Starting in Microsoft Edge 112, such constraints in certificates loaded from the platform certificate store will now be enforced.

This policy exists as a temporary opt-out in case an enterprise encounters issues with the constraints encoded in their private roots. In that case this policy may be used to temporarily disable enforcement of the constraints while correcting the certificate issues.

If you enable this policy or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge will enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will not enforce constraints encoded into trust anchors loaded from the platform trust store.

This policy has no effect if the [MicrosoftRootStoreEnabled](#microsoftrootstoreenabled) policy is disabled.

This policy is planned to be removed in Microsoft Edge version 118.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No

  ### ExemptDomainFileTypePairsFromFileTypeDownloadWarnings

  #### Disable download file type extension-based warnings for specified file types on domains (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 109.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85, until 109

  #### Description

  This policy has been obsoleted in favor of [ExemptFileTypeDownloadWarnings](#exemptfiletypedownloadwarnings) because of a type mismatch that caused errors in Mac.

You can enable this policy to create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from file type extension-based download warnings. This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the "jnlp" extension is associated with "website1.com", users would not see a warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website1.com", but see a download warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website2.com".

Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.

If you enable this policy:

* The URL pattern should be formatted according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).
* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list "jnlp" should be used instead of ".jnlp".

Example:

The following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.

[
  { "file_extension": "jnlp", "domains": ["contoso.com"] },
  { "file_extension": "exe", "domains": ["contoso.com"] },
  { "file_extension": "swf", "domains": ["*"] }
]

Note that while the preceding example shows the suppression of file type extension-based download warnings for "swf" files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains for any dangerous file type extension is not recommended due to security concerns. It is shown in the example merely to demonstrate the ability to do so.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
  - Per Profile: Yes
  - Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes

  ### ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl

  #### Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  The Experimentation and Configuration Service is used to deploy Experimentation and Configuration payloads to the client.

Experimentation payload consists of a list of early in development features that Microsoft is enabling for testing and feedback.

Configuration payload consists of a list of recommended settings that Microsoft wants to deploy to optimize the user experience.

Configuration payload may also contain a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.

If you set this policy to 'FullMode', the full payload is downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service. This includes both the experimentation and configuration payloads.

If you set this policy to 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode', only the configuration payload is downloaded.

If you set this policy to 'RestrictedMode', the communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service is stopped completely. Microsoft does not recommend this setting.

If you don't configure this policy on a managed device, the behavior on Beta and Stable channels is the same as the 'ConfigurationsOnlyMode'. On Canary and Dev channels the behavior is the same as 'FullMode'.

If you don't configure this policy on an unmanaged device, the behavior is the same as the 'FullMode'.

Policy options mapping:

* FullMode (2) = Retrieve configurations and experiments

* ConfigurationsOnlyMode (1) = Retrieve configurations only

* RestrictedMode (0) = Disable communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### ExplicitlyAllowedNetworkPorts

  #### Explicitly allowed network ports

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 91 or later

  #### Description

  There is a list of restricted ports built into Microsoft Edge. Connections to these ports will fail. This policy allows bypassing that list. The set of ports is defined as a comma-separated list that outgoing connections should be permitted on.

Ports are restricted to prevent Microsoft Edge from being used as a vector to exploit various network vulnerabilities. Setting this policy may expose your network to attacks. This policy is intended as a temporary workaround for error code "ERR_UNSAFE_PORT" while migrating a service running on a blocked port to a standard port (for example port 80 or 443).

Malicious websites can easily detect that this policy is set, and for which ports, then use that information to target attacks.

Each port listed in this policy is labeled with a date that it can be unblocked until. After that date the port will be restricted regardless of if it's specified by the value of this policy.

Leaving the value empty or unset means that all restricted ports will be blocked. Invalid port values set through this policy will be ignored while valid ones will still be applied.

This policy overrides the "--explicitly-allowed-ports" command-line option.

Policy options mapping:

* 554 (554) = port 554 (can be unblocked until 2021/10/15)

* 10080 (10080) = port 10080 (can be unblocked until 2022/04/01)

* 6566 (6566) = port 6566 (can be unblocked until 2021/10/15)

* 989 (989) = port 989 (can be unblocked until 2022/02/01)

* 990 (990) = port 990 (can be unblocked until 2022/02/01)

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

If you configure this policy to 'BingSafeSearchStrictMode', the strict setting in SafeSearch is used. The strict setting filters adult text, images, and videos.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, SafeSearch in Bing search isn't enforced, and users can set the value they want on bing.com.

Policy options mapping:

* BingSafeSearchNoRestrictionsMode (0) = Don't configure search restrictions in Bing

* BingSafeSearchModerateMode (1) = Configure moderate search restrictions in Bing

* BingSafeSearchStrictMode (2) = Configure strict search restrictions in Bing

  ### ForceCertificatePromptsOnMultipleMatches

  #### Configure whether Microsoft Edge should automatically select a certificate when there are multiple certificate matches for a site configured with "AutoSelectCertificateForUrls" (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because we are moving to a new policy. It won't work in Microsoft Edge version 104. The new policy to use is [PromptOnMultipleMatchingCertificates](#promptonmultiplematchingcertificates).

Toggles whether users are prompted to select a certificate if there are multiple certificates available and a site is configured with [AutoSelectCertificateForUrls](#autoselectcertificateforurls). If you don't configure [AutoSelectCertificateForUrls](#autoselectcertificateforurls) for a site, the user will always be prompted to select a certificate.

If you set this policy to True, Microsoft Edge will prompt a user to select a certificate for sites on the list defined in [AutoSelectCertificateForUrls](#autoselectcertificateforurls) if and only if there is more than one certificate.

If you set this policy to False or don't configure it, Microsoft Edge will automatically select a certificate even if there are multiple matches for a certificate. The user will not be prompted to select a certificate for sites on the list defined in [AutoSelectCertificateForUrls](#autoselectcertificateforurls).

  ### ForceEphemeralProfiles

  #### Enable use of ephemeral profiles

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Controls whether user profiles are switched to ephemeral mode. An ephemeral profile is created when a session begins, is deleted when the session ends, and is associated with the user's original profile.

If you enable this policy, profiles run in ephemeral mode. This lets users work from their own devices without saving browsing data to those devices. If you enable this policy as an OS policy (by using GPO on Windows, for example), it applies to every profile on the system.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, users get their regular profiles when they sign in to the browser.

In ephemeral mode, profile data is saved on disk only for the length of the user session. Features like browser history, extensions and their data, web data like cookies, and web databases aren't saved after the browser is closed. This doesn't prevent a user from manually downloading any data to disk, or from saving pages or printing them. If the user has enabled sync, all data is preserved in their sync accounts just like with regular profiles. Users can also use InPrivate browsing in ephemeral mode unless you explicitly disable this.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
  - Per Profile: Yes

  ### ForceGoogleSafeSearch

  #### Enforce Google SafeSearch

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Forces queries in Google Web Search to be performed with SafeSearch set to active, and prevents users from changing this setting.

If you enable this policy, SafeSearch in Google Search is always active.

If you disable this policy or don't configure it, SafeSearch in Google Search isn't enforced.

  ### ForceLegacyDefaultReferrerPolicy

  #### Use a default referrer policy of no-referrer-when-downgrade (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 88.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81, until 88

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their web content if it was found to be incompatible with the new default referrer policy.

Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy was strengthened from the value of no-referrer-when-downgrade to the more secure strict-origin-when-cross-origin.

When this enterprise policy is enabled, Microsoft Edge's default referrer policy will be set to its old value of no-referrer-when-downgrade.

This enterprise policy is disabled by default.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes

  ### ForceMajorVersionToMinorPositionInUserAgent

  #### Enable or disable freezing the User-Agent string at major version 99

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 99 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls whether the User-Agent string major
version should be frozen at 99.

The User-Agent request header lets websites identify the application,
operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.
Some websites make assumptions about how this header is formatted and may
encounter issues with version strings that include three digits in the
major position (for example, 100.0.0.0).

Setting the policy to 'Default' or leaving it unset will default to
browser settings for the User-Agent string major version.
If set to 'ForceEnabled', the User-Agent string will always report the
major version as 99 and include the browser's major version in the minor
position. For example, browser version 101.0.0.0 would send a User-Agent
request header that reports version 99.101.0.0.
If set to 'ForceDisabled', the User-Agent string will not freeze the
major version.

This policy is temporary and will be deprecated in the future. Note that
if this policy and
User-Agent Reduction are
both enabled, the User-Agent version string will always be 99.0.0.0.

Policy options mapping:

* Default (0) = Default to browser settings for User-Agent string version.

* ForceDisabled (1) = The User-Agent string will not freeze the major version.

* ForceEnabled (2) = The User-Agent string will freeze the major version as 99 and include the browser's major version in the minor position.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### ForceNetworkInProcess

  #### Force networking code to run in the browser process (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 83.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78, until 83

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to migrate to 3rd party software that doesn't depend on hooking networking APIs. Proxy servers are recommended over LSPs and Win32 API patching.

This policy forces networking code to run in the browser process.

This policy is disabled by default. If enabled, users are open to security issues when the networking process is sandboxed.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart

  ### ForceSync

  #### Force synchronization of browser data and do not show the sync consent prompt

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 86 or later

  #### Description

  Forces data synchronization in Microsoft Edge. This policy also prevents the user from turning sync off.

If you don't configure this policy, users will be able to turn sync on or off. If you enable this policy, users will not be able to turn sync off.

For this policy to work as intended,
[BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) policy must not be configured, or must be set to enabled. If [BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) is set to disabled, then [ForceSync](#forcesync) will not take affect.

[SyncDisabled](#syncdisabled) must not be configured or must be set to False. If this is set to True, [ForceSync](#forcesync) will not take affect. If you wish to ensure specific datatypes sync or do not sync, use the [ForceSyncTypes](#forcesynctypes) policy and [SyncTypesListDisabled](#synctypeslistdisabled) policy.

0 = Do not automatically start sync and show the sync consent (default)
1 = Force sync to be turned on for Azure AD/Azure AD-Degraded user profile and do not show the sync consent prompt

  ### GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled

  #### Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

If you disable or don't set this policy, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site. So, if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If you enable this policy HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another site.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures and will be removed in the future.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar

  #### Force direct intranet site navigation instead of searching on single word entries in the Address Bar

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 78 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable this policy, the top auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will navigate to intranet sites if the text entered in the address bar is a single word without punctuation.

Default navigation when typing a single word without punctuation will conduct a navigation to an intranet site matching the entered text.

If you enable this policy, the second auto-suggest result in the address bar suggestion list will conduct a web search exactly as it was entered, provided that this text is a single word without punctuation. The default search provider will be used unless a policy to prevent web search is also enabled.

Two effects of enabling this policy are:

Navigation to sites in response to single word queries that would typically resolve to a history item will no longer happen. Instead, the browser will attempt navigate to internal sites that may not exist in an organization's intranet. This will result in a 404 error.

Popular, single-word search terms will require manual selection of search suggestions to properly conduct a search.

  #### Supported features:

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 79 or later

  #### Description

  Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that bypass preloaded HSTS upgrades from http to https.

Only single-label hostnames are allowed in this policy, and this policy only applies to static HSTS-preloaded entries (for example, "app", "new", "search", "play"). This policy does not prevent HSTS upgrades for servers that have dynamically requested HSTS upgrades using a Strict-Transport-Security response header.

Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific single-label hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.

  #### Allow importing of search engine settings

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Allows users to import search engine settings from another browser into Microsoft Edge.

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 86 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls the handling of insecure forms (forms submitted over HTTP) embedded in secure (HTTPS) sites in the browser.
If you enable this policy or don't set it, a full page warning will be shown when an insecure form is submitted. Additionally, a warning bubble will be shown next to the form fields when they are focused, and autofill will be disabled for those forms.
If you disable this policy, warnings will not be shown for insecure forms, and autofill will work normally.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
  - Per Profile: Yes
  - Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No

  ### IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled

  #### Control the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 85 or later

  #### Description

  When enabled the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature causes Javascript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced, running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5 minutes or more.

This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

If you enable this policy, the feature will be force enabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you disable this policy, the feature will be force disabled, and users will not be able to override this setting.
If you don't configure this policy, the feature will be controlled by its own internal logic. Users can manually configure this setting.

Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full restart is required to ensure that all the loaded tabs receive a consistent policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different values of this policy.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes
  - Per Profile: No

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationAlwaysUseOSCapture

  #### Always use the OS capture engine to avoid issues with capturing Internet Explorer mode tabs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 106 or later

  #### Description

  Configure this policy to control whether Microsoft Edge will use the "OS capture engine" or the "Browser capture engine" when capturing browser windows in the same process using the screen-share APIs.

You should configure this policy if you want to capture the contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs. However, enabling this policy may negatively impact performance when capturing browser windows in the same process.

This policy only affects window capture, not tab capture. The contents of Internet Explorer mode tabs will not be captured when you choose to capture only a single tab, even if you configure this policy.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will always use the OS capture engine for window capture. Internet Explorer mode tabs will have their contents captured.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the Browser capture engine for browser windows in the same process. Internet Explorer mode tabs in these windows will not have their contents captured.

To learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174004](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2174004)

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationAlwaysWaitForUnload

  #### Wait for Internet Explorer mode tabs to completely unload before ending the browser session

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 105 or later

  #### Description

  This policy causes Microsoft Edge to continue running until all Internet Explorer tabs have completely finished unloading. This allows Internet Explorer plugins like ActiveX controls to perform additional critical work even after the browser has been closed. However, this can cause stability and performance issues, and Microsoft Edge processes may remain active in the background with no visible windows if the webpage or plugin prevents Internet Explorer from unloading. This policy should only be used if your organization depends on a plugin that requires this behavior.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge will always wait for Internet Explorer mode tabs to fully unload before ending the browser session.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will not always wait for Internet Explorer mode tabs to fully unload before ending the browser session.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudNeutralSitesReporting

  #### Configure reporting of potentially misconfigured neutral site URLs to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 99 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you enable reporting of sites that might need to be configured as a neutral site on the Enterprise Mode Site List. The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account for reports to be sent, and the user's account tenant must match the tenant specified by the policy.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will send a report to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app when a navigation appears stuck redirecting back and forth between the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer engines several times. This usually indicates that redirection to an authentication server is switching engines, which repeatedly fails in a loop. The report will show the URL of the site that is the redirect target, minus any query string or fragment. The user's identity isn't reported.

For this reporting to work correctly, you must have successfully visited the Microsoft Edge Site Lists app in the M365 Admin Center at least once. This activates a per-tenant storage account used to store these reports. Microsoft Edge will still attempt to send reports if this step hasn't been completed. However, the reports will not be stored in the Site Lists app.

When enabling this policy, you must specify your O365 tenant ID. To learn more about finding your O365 tenant ID, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185668](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185668)

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will never send reports about potentially misconfigured neutral sites to the Site Lists app.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList

  #### Configure the Enterprise Mode Cloud Site List

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 93 or later

  #### Description

  The Microsoft Edge Site Lists setting in the M365 Admin Center allows you to host your site list(s) in a compliant cloud location and manage the contents of your site list(s) through the built-in experience. This setting allows you to specify which site list within the M365 Admin Center to deploy to your users. The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account. Otherwise, Microsoft Edge will not download the site list from the cloud location.

This setting is applicable only when the [InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) setting is configured.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the specified site list. When enabled, you can enter the identifier of the site list that you created and published to the cloud in M365 Admin Center.

This setting takes precedence over Microsoft Edge's [InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy as well as Internet Explorer's site list setting (Use the Enterprise mode IE website list). If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use the [InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy instead.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudUserSitesReporting

  #### Configure reporting of IE Mode user list entries to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 99 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you enable reporting of sites that Microsoft Edge users add to their local IE Mode site list. The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account for reports to be sent, and the user's account tenant must match the tenant specified by the policy.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will send a report to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app when a user adds a site to their local IE mode site list. The report will show the URL of the site the user added, minus any query string or fragment. The user's identity isn't reported.

For this reporting to work correctly, you must have successfully visited the Microsoft Edge Site Lists app in the M365 Admin Center at least once. This activates a per-tenant storage account used to store these reports. Microsoft Edge will still attempt to send reports if this step hasn't been completed.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationEnhancedHangDetection

  #### Configure enhanced hang detection for Internet Explorer mode

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Enhanced hang detection is a more granular approach to detecting hung webpages in Internet Explorer mode than what standalone Internet Explorer uses. When a hung webpage is detected, the browser will apply a mitigation to prevent the rest of the browser from hanging.

This setting allows you to configure the use of enhanced hang detection in case you run into incompatible issues with any of your websites. We recommend disabling this policy only if you see notifications such as "(website) is not responding" in Internet Explorer mode but not in standalone Internet Explorer.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

If you set this policy to 'Enabled' or don't configure it, websites running in Internet Explorer mode will use enhanced hang detection.

If you set this policy to 'Disabled', enhanced hang detection is disabled, and users will get the basic Internet Explorer hang detection behavior.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed

  #### Allow unconfigured sites to be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 92 or later

  #### Description

  This policy allows users to reload unconfigured sites (that are not configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List) in Internet Explorer mode when browsing in Microsoft Edge and a site requires Internet Explorer for compatibility.

After a site has been reloaded in Internet Explorer mode, "in-page" navigations will stay in Internet Explorer mode (for example, a link, script, or form on the page, or a server-side redirect from another "in-page" navigation). Users can choose to exit from Internet Explorer mode, or Microsoft Edge will automatically exit from Internet Explorer mode when a navigation that isn't "in-page" occurs (for example, using the address bar, the back button, or a favorite link).

Users can also optionally tell Microsoft Edge to use Internet Explorer mode for the site in the future. This choice will be remembered for a length of time managed by the [InternetExplorerIntegrationLocalSiteListExpirationDays](#internetexplorerintegrationlocalsitelistexpirationdays) policy.

If the [InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) policy is set to 'IEMode', then sites explicitly configured by the [InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy's site list to use Microsoft Edge can't be reloaded in Internet Explorer mode, and sites configured by the site list or by the [SendIntranetToInternetExplorer](#sendintranettointernetexplorer) policy to use Internet Explorer mode can't exit from Internet Explorer mode.

If you enable this policy, users are allowed to reload unconfigured sites in Internet Explorer mode.

If you disable this policy, users aren't allowed to reload unconfigured sites in Internet Explorer mode.

Note that if you enable this policy, it takes precedence over how you configured the [InternetExplorerIntegrationTestingAllowed](#internetexplorerintegrationtestingallowed) policy, and that policy will be disabled.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteListRefreshInterval

  #### Configure how frequently the Enterprise Mode Site List is refreshed

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 93 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you specify a custom refresh interval for the Enterprise Mode Site List. The refresh interval is specified in minutes. The minimum refresh interval is 30 minutes.

This setting is applicable only when the [InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) or [InternetExplorerIntegrationCloudSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationcloudsitelist) setting is configured.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will attempt to retrieve an updated version of the configured Enterprise Mode Site List using the specified refresh interval.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will use a default refresh interval, currently 120 minutes.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteRedirect

  #### Specify how "in-page" navigations to unconfigured sites behave when started from Internet Explorer mode pages

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 81 or later

  #### Description

  An "in-page" navigation is started from a link, a script, or a form on the current page. It can also be a server-side redirect of a previous "in-page" navigation attempt. Conversely, a user can start a navigation that isn't "in-page" that's independent of the current page in several ways by using the browser controls. For example, using the address bar, the back button, or a favorite link.

This setting lets you specify whether navigations from pages loaded in Internet Explorer mode to unconfigured sites (that are not configured in the Enterprise Mode Site List) switch back to Microsoft Edge or remain in Internet Explorer mode.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, only sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will open in that mode. Any site not configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will be redirected back to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'Default', only sites configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will open in that mode. Any site not configured to open in Internet Explorer mode will be redirected back to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'AutomaticNavigationsOnly', you get the default experience except that all automatic navigations (such as 302 redirects) to unconfigured sites will be kept in Internet Explorer mode.

If you set this policy to 'AllInPageNavigations', all navigations from pages loaded in IE mode to unconfigured sites are kept in Internet Explorer mode (Least Recommended).

If the [InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed) policy allows users to reload sites in Internet Explorer mode, then all in-page navigations from unconfigured sites that users have chosen to reload in Internet Explorer mode will be kept in Internet Explorer mode, regardless of how this policy is configured.

To learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2105106](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2105106)

Policy options mapping:

* Default (0) = Default

* AutomaticNavigationsOnly (1) = Keep only automatic navigations in Internet Explorer mode

* AllInPageNavigations (2) = Keep all in-page navigations in Internet Explorer mode

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### InternetExplorerIntegrationTestingAllowed

  #### Allow Internet Explorer mode testing (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 94.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 86, until 94

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete because it has been superseded by an improved feature. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 94. To allow users to open applications in Internet Explorer mode, use the [InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed) policy instead. Alternatively, users can still use the --ie-mode-test flag.

This policy allows users to test applications in Internet Explorer mode by opening an Internet Explorer mode tab in Microsoft Edge.

Users can do so from within the "More tools" menu by selecting 'Open sites in Internet Explorer mode'.

Additionally, users can test their applications in a modern browser without removing applications from the site list using the option 'Open sites in Edge mode'.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'.

If you enable this policy, the option to 'Open sites in Internet Explorer mode' will be visible under "More tools". Users can view their sites in Internet Explorer mode on this tab. Another option to 'Open sites in Edge mode' will also be visible under "More tools" to help testing sites in a modern browser without removing them from the site list. Note that if the [InternetExplorerIntegrationReloadInIEModeAllowed](#internetexplorerintegrationreloadiniemodeallowed) policy is enabled, it takes precedence and these options will not be visible under "More tools".

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can't see the options 'Open in Internet Explorer mode' and 'Open in Edge mode' under "More tools" menu. However, users can configure these options with the --ie-mode-test flag.

  #### Configure the pixel adjustment between window.open heights sourced from IE mode pages vs. Edge mode pages

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 95 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you specify a custom adjustment to the height of popup windows generated via window.open from the Internet Explorer mode site.

If you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will add the adjustment value to the height, in pixels. The exact difference depends on the UI configuration of both IE and Edge, but a typical difference is 5.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will treat IE mode window.open the same as Edge mode window.open in window height calculations.

  ### IntranetRedirectBehavior

  #### Intranet Redirection Behavior

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  This policy configures behavior for intranet redirection via DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

If this policy isn't configured, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

[DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled](#dnsinterceptionchecksenabled) is a related policy that might also disable DNS interception checks. However, this policy is a more flexible version which might separately control intranet redirection infobars and might be expanded in the future.
If either [DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled](#dnsinterceptionchecksenabled) or this policy make a request to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.
If DNS interception checks are disabled by this policy but [GoToIntranetSiteForSingleWordEntryInAddressBar](#gotointranetsiteforsinglewordentryinaddressbar) is enabled, single word queries will still result in intranet navigations.

Policy options mapping:

* Default (0) = Use default browser behavior.

* DisableInterceptionChecksDisableInfobar (1) = Disable DNS interception checks and did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

* DisableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (2) = Disable DNS interception checks; allow did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

* EnableInterceptionChecksEnableInfobar (3) = Allow DNS interception checks and did-you-mean "http://intranetsite/" infobars.

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

For example, specifying https://subdomain.contoso.com/ will cause pages from https://subdomain.contoso.com/ to be isolated in a different process than pages from other Origins within the https://contoso.com/ Site.

If you enable this policy, each of the named origins in a comma-separated list will run in its own process.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, pages will be isolated on a per-Site basis.

  ### ManagedFavorites

  #### Configure favorites

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Configures a list of managed favorites.

The policy creates a list of favorites. Each favorite contains the keys "name" and "url," which hold the favorite's name and its target. You can configure a subfolder by defining a favorites without an "url" key but with an additional "children" key that contains a list of favorites as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Microsoft Edge amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Address Bar, for example "microsoft.com" becomes "https://microsoft.com/".

These favorites are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the favorites bar). By default the folder name is "Managed favorites" but you can change it by adding to the list of favorites a dictionary containing the key "toplevel_name" with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed favorites are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.

If allow_search_engine_discovery isn't specified, search engine discovery will be disabled by default. Starting in Microsoft Edge 84, you can set this policy as a recommended policy to allow search provider discovery. You don't need to add the optional allow_search_engine_discovery parameter. Starting in Microsoft Edge 100, setting this policy as a recommended policy will also allow users to manually add new search engines from their Microsoft Edge settings.

If you enable this policy, users can't add, remove, or change any search engine in the list. Users can set their default search engine to any search engine in the list.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, users can modify the search engines list as desired.

If the [DefaultSearchProviderSearchURL](#defaultsearchprovidersearchurl) policy is set, this policy (ManagedSearchEngines) is ignored. The user must restart their browser to finish applying this policy.

  ### MaxConnectionsPerProxy

  #### Maximum number of concurrent connections to the proxy server

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server.

Some proxy servers can't handle a high number of concurrent connections per client - you can solve this by setting this policy to a lower value.

The value of this policy should be lower than 100 and higher than 6. The default value is 32.

Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs - lowering the maximum connections below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if too many of these kind of web apps are open.

If you don't configure this policy, the default value (32) is used.

  #### Supported features:

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  Allows you to set a timeout, in seconds, for Microsoft Edge tabs waiting to navigate until the browser has downloaded the initial Enterprise Mode Site List.

This setting works in conjunction with:
[InternetExplorerIntegrationLevel](#internetexplorerintegrationlevel) is set to 'IEMode'
and
[InternetExplorerIntegrationSiteList](#internetexplorerintegrationsitelist) policy where the list has at least one entry
and
[DelayNavigationsForInitialSiteListDownload](#delaynavigationsforinitialsitelistdownload) is set to "All eligible navigations" (1).

Tabs will not wait longer than this timeout for the Enterprise Mode Site List to download. If the browser has not finished downloading the Enterprise Mode Site List when the timeout expires, Microsoft Edge tabs will continue navigating anyway. The value of the timeout should be no greater than 20 seconds and no fewer than 1 second.

If you set the timeout in this policy to a value greater than the default of 2 seconds, an information bar is shown to the user after 2 seconds. The information bar contains a button that allows the user to quit waiting for the Enterprise Mode Site List download to complete.

If you don't configure this policy, the default timeout of 2 seconds is used. This default is subject to change in the future.

  ### NetworkServiceSandboxEnabled

  #### Enable the network service sandbox

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 102 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls whether or not the network service process runs sandboxed.
If this policy is enabled, the network service process will run sandboxed.
If this policy is disabled, the network service process will run unsandboxed. This leaves users open to additional security risks related to running the network service unsandboxed.
If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the network sandbox will be used. This may vary depending on Microsoft Edge release, currently running field trials, and platform.
This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the network sandbox if they use third party software that interferes with the network service sandbox.

  ### NonRemovableProfileEnabled

  #### Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 78 or later

  #### Description

  This policy determines if a user can remove the Microsoft Edge profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account.

If you enable this policy, a non-removable profile will be created with the user's work or school account on Windows. This profile can't be signed out or removed. The profile will be non-removable only if profile is signed-in with either on-premises account or Azure AD account that matches OS sign-in account.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the profile automatically signed in with a user's work or school account on Windows can be signed out or removed by the user.

If you want to configure browser sign in, use the [BrowserSignin](#browsersignin) policy.

This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that enrolled for device management.

From Microsoft Edge 89 onwards, if there is an existing on-premises profile with sync disabled and machine is hybrid joined, it will auto-upgrade the on-premises profile to Azure AD profile and make it non-removable instead of creating a new non-removable Azure AD profile.

From Microsoft Edge 93 onwards, if policy [ImplicitSignInEnabled](#implicitsigninenabled) is disabled, this policy will not take any effect.

  #### Supported features:

  ### OriginAgentClusterDefaultEnabled

  #### Origin-keyed agent clustering enabled by default

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 103 or later

  #### Description

  The Origin-Agent-Cluster: HTTP header controls whether a document is isolated in an origin-keyed agent cluster or in a site-keyed agent cluster. This has security implications because an origin-keyed agent cluster allows isolating documents by origin. The consequence of this for developers is that the document.domain accessor can no longer be set when origin-keyed agent clustering is enabled.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, documents without the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header will be assigned to origin-keyed agent clustering by default. On these documents, the document.domain accessor will not be settable.

If you disable this policy, documents without the Origin-Agent-Cluster: header will be assigned to site-keyed agent clusters by default. On these documents, the document.domain accessor will be settable.

See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2191896](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2191896) for additional details.

  ### OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin

  #### Control where security restrictions on insecure origins apply

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (like "*.contoso.com") for which security restrictions on insecure origins don't apply.

This policy lets you specify allowed origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development so that developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If you enable this policy, it overrides the command-line flag.

For more information on secure contexts, see https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.

  ### RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerPreventBHOInstall

  #### Prevent install of the BHO to redirect incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 87 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you specify whether to block the install of the Browser Helper Object (BHO) that enables redirecting incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge for sites that require a modern browser.

If you enable this policy, the BHO will not be installed. If it is already installed it will be uninstalled on the next Microsoft Edge update.

If this policy is not configured or is disabled, the BHO will be installed.

The BHO is required for incompatible site redirection to occur, however whether redirection occurs or not is also controlled by [RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerRedirectMode](#redirectsitesfrominternetexplorerredirectmode).

  ### RedirectSitesFromInternetExplorerRedirectMode

  #### Redirect incompatible sites from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 87 or later

  #### Description

  This setting lets you specify whether Internet Explorer will redirect navigations to sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge.
If you set this policy to 'Disable' ('Prevent redirection', value 0), Internet Explorer will not redirect any traffic to Microsoft Edge.

If you set this policy to 'Sitelist', starting with Microsoft Edge major release 87 , Internet Explorer (IE) will redirect sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge. (Note: The Sitelist setting is 'Redirect sites based on the incompatible sites sitelist', value 1).

When a site is redirected from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge, the Internet Explorer tab that started loading the site is closed if it had no prior content. Otherwise, the user is taken to a Microsoft help page that explains why the site was redirected to Microsoft Edge. When Microsoft Edge is launched to load an IE site, an information bar explains that the site works best in a modern browser.

If you want to redirect all navigations, you can configure the Disable Internet Explorer 11 policy, which redirects all navigations from IE11 to Microsoft Edge. It also hides the IE11 app icon from the user after the first launch.

If don't configure this policy:
  - Starting with Microsoft Edge major release 87, you will have the same experience as setting the policy to 'Sitelist': Internet Explorer will redirect sites that require a modern browser to Microsoft Edge.
  - In the future, the default for your organization might change to automatically redirect all navigations. If you don't want automatic redirection, set this policy to 'Disable' or 'Sitelist'.

For more information about this policy see  [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141715](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141715)

Policy options mapping:

* Disable (0) = Prevent redirection

* Sitelist (1) = Redirect sites based on the incompatible sites sitelist

  ### RelaunchNotification

  #### Notify a user that a browser restart is recommended or required for pending updates

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Notify users that they need to restart Microsoft Edge to apply a pending update.

If you don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge adds a recycle icon at the far right of the top menu bar to prompt users to restart the browser to apply the update.

If you enable this policy and set it to 'Recommended', a recurring warning prompts users that a restart is recommended. Users can dismiss this warning and defer the restart.

If you set the policy to 'Required', a recurring warning prompts users that the browser will be restarted automatically as soon as a notification period passes. The default period is seven days. You can configure this period with the [RelaunchNotificationPeriod](#relaunchnotificationperiod) policy.

The user's session is restored when the browser restarts.

Policy options mapping:

* Recommended (1) = Recommended - Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a restart is recommended

* Required (2) = Required - Show a recurring prompt to the user indicating that a restart is required

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. In Microsoft Edge the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the [RelaunchNotification](#relaunchnotification) policy follow this same schedule.

If not set, the default period of 604800000 milliseconds (one week) is used.

  ### RelaunchWindow

  #### Set the time interval for relaunch

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 93 or later

  #### Description

  Specifies a target time window for the end of the relaunch notification period.

Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the [RelaunchNotification](#relaunchnotification) and [RelaunchNotificationPeriod](#relaunchnotificationperiod) policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the [RelaunchNotification](#relaunchnotification) policy is set to 'Required'. This RelaunchWindow policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

If you don't configure this policy, the default target time window is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

Note: Though the policy can accept multiple items in entries, all but the first item are ignored.
Warning: Setting this policy may delay application of software updates.

  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Determines which accounts can be used to sign in to the Microsoft Edge account that's chosen during the Sync opt-in flow.

If you don't configure this policy or leave it blank, users can use any account to sign in to Microsoft Edge.

  ### SetTimeoutWithout1MsClampEnabled

  #### Control Javascript setTimeout() function minimum timeout (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 101, until 109

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete and doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 109.
This policy was only provided temporarily to allow Enterprises to adapt to the new clamping behavior.

   When the policy is set to Enabled, the Javascript setTimeout() with a timeout of 0ms will no longer be fixed to 1ms to schedule timer-based callbacks.
   When the policy is set to Disabled, the Javascript setTimeout() with a timeout of 0ms will be fixed to 1ms to schedule timer-based callbacks.
   When the policy is unset, use the browser's default behavior for setTimeout() function.

   This is a web standards compliancy feature, but it may change task ordering on a web page, leading to unexpected behavior on sites that are dependent on a certain ordering.
   It also may affect sites with a lot of setTimeout()s with a timeout of 0ms usage. For example, increasing CPU load.

   For users where this policy is unset, Microsoft Edge Stable will roll out the change gradually on the stable channel.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No

  ### ShadowStackCrashRollbackBehavior

  #### Configure ShadowStack crash rollback behavior (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 109.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 95, until 109

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because it's intended to serve only as a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to update their environments and report issues if they are found to be incompatible with Hardware-enforced Stack Protection. It won't work in Microsoft Edge as soon as version 109.

Microsoft Edge includes a Hardware-enforced Stack Protection security feature. This feature may result in the browser crashing unexpectedly in cases that do not represent an attempt to compromise the browser's security.

Using this policy, you may control the behavior of the Hardware-enforced Stack Protection feature after a crash triggered by this feature is encountered.

Set this policy to 'Disable' to disable the feature.

Set this policy to 'DisableUntilUpdate' to disable the feature until Microsoft Edge updates next time.

Set this policy to 'Enable' to keep the feature enabled.

Policy options mapping:

* Disable (0) = Disable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection

* DisableUntilUpdate (1) = Disable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection until the next Microsoft Edge update

* Enable (2) = Enable Hardware-enforced Stack Protection

Use the preceding information when configuring this policy.

  ### TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled

  #### Enable a TLS 1.3 security feature for local trust anchors (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 85.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 81, until 85

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work because it was only intended to be a short-term mechanism to give enterprises more time to upgrade affected proxies.

This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 that protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.

If you enable this policy or don't set it, Microsoft Edge will enable these security protections for all connections.

If you disable this policy, Microsoft Edge will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.

This policy can be used to test for any affected proxies and upgrade them. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED.

  #### Supported features:

If you don't configure this policy, the browser will choose which TLS cipher suites to use.

Cipher suite values to be disabled are specified as 16-bit hexadecimal values. The values are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) registry.

The TLS 1.3 cipher suite TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x1301) is required for TLS 1.3 and can't be disabled by this policy.

This policy does not affect QUIC-based connections. QUIC can be turned off via the [QuicAllowed](#quicallowed) policy.

  #### Description

  This policy doesn't work, use [SleepingTabsEnabled](#sleepingtabsenabled) instead.

Controls whether Microsoft Edge can freeze tabs that are in the background for at least 5 minutes.

Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery, and memory usage. Microsoft Edge uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background, such as display notifications, play sound, and stream video.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes might be frozen.

If you disable this policy, no tabs will be frozen.

  ### TabServicesEnabled

  #### Enable tab organization suggestions

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 113 or later

  #### Description

  This policy controls whether Microsoft Edge can use its tab organization service to help name or suggest tab groups to increase productivity.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, when a user creates a tab group or activates certain "Group Similar Tabs" features Microsoft Edge sends tab data to its tab organization service. This data includes URLs, page titles, and existing group information. The service uses this data to return suggestions for better groupings and group names.

If you disable this policy, no data will be sent to the tab organization service. Microsoft Edge won't suggest group names when a group is created and certain "Group Similar Tabs" features that rely on the service won't be available.

  ### URLBlocklist

  #### Block access to a list of URLs

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Define a list of sites, based on URL patterns, that are blocked (your users can't load them).

Format the URL pattern according to [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322).

You can define exceptions in the [URLAllowlist](#urlallowlist) policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries are ignored.

Note that blocking internal 'edge://*' URLs isn't recommended - this may lead to unexpected errors.

This policy doesn't prevent the page from updating dynamically through JavaScript. For example, if you block 'contoso.com/abc', users might still be able to visit 'contoso.com' and click on a link to visit 'contoso.com/abc', as long as the page doesn't refresh.

If you don't configure this policy, no URLs are blocked.

This policy does not work as expected with file://* wildcards.

  ### UnthrottledNestedTimeoutEnabled

  #### JavaScript setTimeout will not be clamped until a higher nesting threshold is set (deprecated)

  >DEPRECATED: This policy is deprecated. It is currently supported but will become obsolete in a future release.
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 105 or later

  #### Description

  This policy is deprecated because it is a temporary policy for web standards compliance. It won't work in Microsoft Edge as soon as version 107.
If you enable this policy, the JavaScript setTimeout and setInterval, with an interval smaller than 4ms, will not be clamped. This improves short horizon performance, but websites abusing the API will still eventually have their setTimeout usages clamped.
If you disable or don't configure policy, the JavaScript setTimeout and setInterval, with an interval smaller than 4ms, will be clamped.

This is a web standards compliancy feature that may change task ordering on a web page, leading to unexpected behavior on sites that are dependent on a certain ordering.
It also may affect sites with a lot of usage of a timeout of 0ms for setTimeout. For example, increasing CPU load.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
  - Per Profile: Yes
  - Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: No

  #### Specifies how Microsoft Edge Update handles available updates from Microsoft Edge

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On macOS since 89 or later

  #### Description

  If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge Update handles Microsoft Edge updates according to how you configure the following options:

- Automatic silent updates only: Updates are applied only when they're found by the periodic update check.

- Manual updates only: Updates are applied only when the user runs a manual update check. (Not all apps provide an interface for this option.)

  ### UserAgentClientHintsEnabled

  #### Enable the User-Agent Client Hints feature (obsolete)

  
  >OBSOLETE: This policy is obsolete and doesn't work after Microsoft Edge 93.
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 86, until 93

  #### Description

  This policy is obsolete because it was intended for short-term adaptation purposes only. It doesn't work in Microsoft Edge after version 93.

When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers that provide information about the user browser (for example, the browser version) and environment (for example, the system architecture).

This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If you disable this policy, this feature is unavailable.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes

  ### UserAgentClientHintsGREASEUpdateEnabled

  #### Control the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 102 or later

  #### Description

  The User-Agent GREASE specification recommends the inclusion of additional GREASE characters beyond the current semicolon and space, and recommends that the arbitrary version number be varied over time.

When enabled, the User-Agent Client Hints GREASE Update feature aligns the User-Agent GREASE algorithm with the latest version from the specification.  The updated specification may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain. For more information, see the following specification: https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/#grease

If this policy is enabled or not configured, the User-Agent GREASE algorithm from the specification will be used. If the policy is disabled, the prior User-Agent GREASE algorithm will be used.

This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in a future release.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes

  ### UserDataDir

  #### Set the user data directory

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 77 or later

  #### Description

  Set the directory to use for storing user data.

If you enable this policy, Microsoft Edge uses the specified directory regardless of whether the user has set the '--user-data-dir' command-line flag.

If you don't enable this policy, the default profile path is used, but the user can override it by using the '--user-data-dir' flag. Users can find the directory for the profile at edge://version/ under profile path.

To avoid data loss or other errors, don't configure this policy to a volume's root directory or to a directory that's used for other purposes, because Microsoft Edge manages its contents.

See [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095041) for a list of variables that can be used.

  ### UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit

  #### Limits the number of user data snapshots retained for use in case of emergency rollback

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 86 or later

  #### Description

  Following each major version update, Microsoft Edge will create a snapshot of parts of the user's browsing data to use in case of a later emergency that requires a temporary version rollback. If a temporary rollback is performed to a version for which a user has a corresponding snapshot, the data in the snapshot is restored. This lets users keep settings such as bookmarks and autofill data.

If you don't set this policy, the default value of 3 snapshots is used.

If you set this policy, old snapshots are deleted as needed to respect the limit you set. If you set this policy to 0, no snapshots are taken.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes

  ### VerticalTabsAllowed

  #### Configures availability of a vertical layout for tabs on the side of the browser

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 88 or later

  #### Description

  Configures whether a user can access an alternative layout where tabs are vertically aligned on the side of the browser instead of at the top.
When there are several tabs open, this layout provides better tab viewing and management. There's better visibility of the site titles,
it's easier to scan aligned icons, and there's more space to manage and close tabs.

If you disable this policy, then the vertical tab layout will not be available as an option for users.

If you enable or don't configure this policy, the tab layout will still be at the top, but a user has the option to turn on vertical tabs on the side.

  #### Supported features:

  ### WebAppInstallForceList

  #### Configure list of force-installed Web Apps

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows and macOS since 80 or later

  #### Description

  Configure this policy to specify a list of web apps that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member:
url (the URL of the web app to install)

and 5 optional members:
- default_launch_container
(specifies the window mode that the web app opens with-a new tab is the
default.)

- create_desktop_shortcut
(True if you want to create Linux and
Microsoft Windows desktop shortcuts).

- fallback_app_name
(Starting with Microsoft Edge version 90,
allows you to override the app name if it is not a
Progressive Web App (PWA), or the app name that is temporarily
installed if it is a PWA but authentication is required before the
installation can be completed. If both
custom_name and
fallback_app_name are provided,
the latter will be ignored.)

- custom_name
(Starting with Microsoft Edge version 112,
allows you to override the app name of installed apps.)

- custom_icon
(Starting with Microsoft Edge version 112,
allows you to override the app icon of installed apps. The icons have to
be square, have a maximum file size of 1 MB, and in one of the following formats:
jpeg, png, gif, webp, ico. The hash value has to be the SHA256 hash of the icon file.)

- install_as_shortcut
(Starting with Microsoft Edge
version 107). If enabled the given url will be installed as a shortcut,
as if done via the "Create Shortcut..." option in the desktop browser GUI.
Note that when installed as a shortcut it won't be updated if the manifest in url changes.
If disabled or unset, the web app at the given url will be installed normally.
Not currently supported in Microsoft Edge.)

  ### WinHttpProxyResolverEnabled

  #### Use Windows proxy resolver

  
  
  #### Supported versions:

  - On Windows since 84 or later

  #### Description

  This policy will be superseded by a similar feature in a future release. For more information, see https://crbug.com/1032820.

Use Windows to resolve proxies for all browser networking instead of the proxy resolver built into Microsoft Edge. The Windows proxy resolver enables Windows proxy features such as DirectAccess/NRPT.

This policy comes with the problems described by https://crbug.com/644030. It causes PAC files to be fetched and executed by Windows code, including PAC files set via the [ProxyPacUrl](#proxypacurl) policy. Since Network Fetches for the PAC file happen via Windows instead of Microsoft Edge code, network policies such as [DnsOverHttpsMode](#dnsoverhttpsmode) will not apply to network fetches for a PAC file.

If you enable this policy, the Windows proxy resolver will be used.

If you disable or don't configure this policy, the Microsoft Edge proxy resolver will be used.

  #### Supported features:

  - Can be mandatory: Yes
  - Can be recommended: No
  - Dynamic Policy Refresh: No - Requires browser restart
  - Per Profile: No
  - Applies to a profile that is signed in with a Microsoft account: Yes
