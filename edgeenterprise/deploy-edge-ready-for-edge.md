# Ready for Microsoft Edge

The article provides information for the IT Administrator who's planning a Microsoft Edge deployment and needs information about application compatibility and support.

## Web application compatibility and support

To help you plan your deployment of Microsoft Edge, we've compiled a list of web applications that may be in use within your organization. This list lets you determine if the web application is ready for Microsoft Edge, as documented by the web application provider’s public support statement.

### Add to the application list

The list is regularly updated as support statements are identified from customer engagement feedback.

If you are a web app provider and would like your support statement included for customer reference, please mail the following information to [isvoutreach@microsoft.com](mailto:isvoutreach@microsoft.com).

- Product name
- Version Supported (if applicable)
- Provider Name
- Public Support Statement URL

### Application list

Microsoft doesn't test or certify these applications in Microsoft Edge. The list was compiled based on publicly available resources. Always refer to the provider’s current support statement. Some applications may require the use of IE Mode as indicated by the support statement.

The following table lists provider support statements for Microsoft Edge.
