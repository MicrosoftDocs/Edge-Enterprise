# Microsoft Edge Enterprise Roadmap

This article describes the roadmap for Microsoft Edge Enterprise.

## Roadmap

Microsoft Edge has been added to the [M365 Roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=Microsoft%2CEdge). Over time, you'll see the Microsoft Edge roadmap fill with more features and you can filter by selecting Microsoft Edge from the Products section. We are working to continuously improve the experience and we welcome your feedback. Take a look at what we currently have planned for the upcoming Microsoft Edge releases. 

### Site compatibility changes

The web is constantly evolving to improve the user experience, security, and privacy. In some cases, changes are significant enough to impact the functionality of existing webpages.

Visit the [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes) site to see the high-impact changes that the Microsoft Edge team is currently tracking. Check back often; the Microsoft Edge team updates this page as timelines solidify and new changes are announced.
