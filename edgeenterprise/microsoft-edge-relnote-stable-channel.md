## Version 119.0.2151.44: November 2, 2023

Fixed various bugs and performance issues.

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#november-2-2023).

### Feature updates

- **Compression Dictionary Transport support.** A version of the [Compression Dictionary Transport](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-compression-dictionary/) feature is available for sites to use by participating in the associated origin trial. If your network uses a middlebox that inspects network traffic and/or you previously encountered issues with the ZSDCH feature, review the [Considerations for zstd-based Shared Dictionary Compression for HTTP](/DeployEdge/learnmore-zsdch-compression) page which contains updated guidance.

- **Behavioral changes to the before-unload event.** The behavior of the before-unload event has changed such that calling preventDefault in a before-unload event handler triggers a confirmation dialog. Setting returnValue to an empty string in a before-unload event handler no longer triggers a confirmation dialog. This behavior takes effect starting in Microsoft Edge version 119. Administrators can temporarily opt out of this functionality by disabling the [BeforeunloadEventCancelByPreventDefaultEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#beforeunloadeventcancelbypreventdefaultenabled) policy.

- **Split screen restore improvements.** Split screen allows you to simultaneously work on multiple tasks across two, side-by-side screens in one browsing tab to boost your productivity and multitask more efficiently. Now after the browser is restarted and the previous session is restored, the split tab will also be restored. 

- **Additional capability to manage sidebar apps.** Administrators can utilize the "sidebar_auto_open_blocked" [ExtensionSettings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#extensionsettings) policy field to control the auto-open behavior of sidebar apps.  For more information, see [Detailed guide to the ExtensionSettings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-manage-extensions-ref-guide) policy.

- **Updates to Microsoft Edge enterprise sync settings page.** When the [ForceSyncTypes](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#forcesynctypes) and [SyncTypesListDisabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#synctypeslistdisabled) policies are used concurrently, the sync settings page (`edge://settings/profiles/sync`) accurately show the status for each data type.

### Policy updates

#### New policies

- [SwitchIntranetSitesToWorkProfile](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#switchintranetsitestoworkprofile) - Switch intranet sites to a work profile
- [SwitchSitesOnIEModeSiteListToWorkProfile](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#switchsitesoniemodesitelisttoworkprofile) - Switch sites on the IE mode site list to a work profile
- [OrganizationalBrandingOnWorkProfileUIEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#organizationalbrandingonworkprofileuienabled) - Allow the use of your organization's branding assets from M365 on the profile-related UI of a work profile

## Version 118.0.2088.69: October 24, 2023

### Feature updates

- **Designer (Preview) in the Microsoft Edge sidebar.**  All Microsoft Edge users with Manifest version 4.8.5 or higher (users can see their version using `edge://sidebar-internals`), including those that are working on managed devices, can now add the Designer (Preview) app to the Edge sidebar by clicking on the "**+**" and setting the Designer (Preview) toggle to on. Designer (Preview) allows you to experience the generative AI capabilities offered by Microsoft Designer [https://designer.microsoft.com](https://designer.microsoft.com) from inside the Edge browser.

  Designer is a new AI system from Microsoft that generates visual, customizable designs based on your text description and images. This release will be available in English for the following countries/regions: Australia, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States.

  Administrators can manage sidebar apps including the Designer (Preview) icon by using the policies described in [Manage the sidebar in Microsoft Edge](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-sidebar). The ID for the Designer (Preview) app is 2cb2db96-3bd0-403e-abe2-9269b3761041.

## Version 118.0.2088.61: October 20, 2023

Stable channel security updates are listed [here](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-relnotes-security#october-13-2023).

### Announcement: Icon change in Edge sidebar

In an upcoming update to Microsoft Edge, the Bing icon entry point in the Microsoft Edge sidebar will change to the new Copilot icon. No other changes in the experience are expected.

### Feature updates

- **Microsoft Edge for Business Banner.**  Microsoft Edge for Business is a dedicated Microsoft Edge experience built for work that enables admins in organizations to give their users a productive and secure work browser across managed and unmanaged devices. The in-product Microsoft Edge for Business banner is being deprecated and will no longer be visible.

- **Find on page.** Searching for a word or phrase on a webpage has become easier with the new smart find update to the Find on page. For more information, see
[Find on page](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/find-on-page?form=MT00D8). Now when you search with Find on the page, we suggest related matches and synonyms making it effortless to find what you're looking for, even if you misspell a word in your search query. When you search, simply select the suggested word to quickly locate the desired word or phrase on the page. Data is sent to Microsoft for processing.  For more information, see [Microsoft Edge's Privacy Whitepaper](/microsoft-edge/privacy-whitepaper/). Administrators can control the availability using the [RelatedMatchesCloudServiceEnabled](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#relatedmatchescloudserviceenabled) policy.

- **New SmartScreen policy.**  The [ExemptSmartScreenDownloadWarnings](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#exemptsmartscreendownloadwarnings) policy lets administrators create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that are exempted from SmartScreen AppRep warnings.  Files with file-type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy are still subject to file-type extension-based security warnings and mixed-content download warnings.

- **New Microsoft Edge Update policies.** The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** and **MeteredUpdates** policies allow administrators to control the "Download Updates over metered connections" setting (`edge://settings/help`). The **MeteredUpdatesDefault** applies to all apps and **MeteredUpdates** applies to targeted apps. When a policy is configured to Allow, updates occur on a metered connection, such as cellular connections or others where data usage is controlled.
